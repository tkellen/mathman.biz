<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Natalie, a 7 year old from
California, worked with Don for 5 days + she continues to work with Don in his
Math By Mail program!</b></font></p>
<p><b>[</b>See what <a href="/html/natalie2.html">Natalie
did at age 8</a>, when she returned to work with Don, August, 2001<b>]</b>.</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Day 1:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
</b>Sunday June 18, 2000 for 1 1/2 hours, an individual session.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Throughout this session, Natalie repeatedly
remarked that she wanted to do hard math and she was bored in school. She will
be going to a new school in the Fall in which parents have a big say in what the
curriculum should be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Natalie worked on the infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 +
1/8 ... coloring in an 8x8 square on 1/2&quot; graph paper (see ch. 1 in the
sample problems). When she colored in 1/2 of 1/2 of 1/2 = 1/8 and was able to
add 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8, Don asked her to write the next four partial
sums.&nbsp; So she had 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, 63/64, 127/128... She said
the top numbers are all odd, the bottom are all even.&nbsp; They talked about
these numbers were increasing. Then Don asked if the sum would ever get to 2.
Natalie said no. Would the sum ever get to 1? It's getting closer to 1, and
Natalie said &quot;each number is 1 fraction less that 1&quot;! This was very
perceptive and showed her ability to see patterns. Don wrote this as 127/128 = 1
-&nbsp; 1/128. Don asked Natalie what would happen if we did 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27
+... She said&nbsp; it will go to 3 of the fractions less than 3!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At this point Don went off to exponents because
the denominators of the fractions were powers of 2 and Natalie hadn't done this.
Don started on the left column first:</font></p>

<p>_________________________________________</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Don gave Natalie a 1 baht coin from Thailand. He asked her
&quot;If 40 baht = $1 (close to the daily exchange rate), how much would each
baht be worth in cents?&quot;</font><font size="1" face="Arial"><sup><sup>&nbsp;
</sup></sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Natalie thought about this</font><sup><sup><font size="1" face="Arial">
</font></sup></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">and said 5x20 = 100. Then after a
little discussion about ?x40=100 and 40 is double 20..and the number had to be
less than 5 and 1/2 of 5 and she came up with 2 1/2' and Don wrote 2 1/2' =
$0.02 1/2&nbsp; .</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">________________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don got Natalie solving some equations:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">2x + 3 = 17&nbsp;&nbsp; (what number multiplied
by 2 then add 3 = 17?). She said 7. Then Don gave her 2x + 3 = 18 and she said 7
1/2 quickly. Don tried to get her to believe 2 x 7 1/2 = 14 1/2, but she
wouldn't accept that; she said one has to take 2- 7's + 2 -halves, and 2x7=14
and 2x 1/2 = 1, so 2x 7 1/2 = 15. Don gave her with the equation 3x + 5 = 19.
She said 4 is too small and 5 is too big. Because she got interested in the peg
game (see ch. 6 of the sample problems) Natalie took this equation back to the
hotel to think about it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Natalie worked hard trying to do the peg game
with 4 pegs on each side. At some point Don suggested that when you have a hard
problem, it is sometimes better to make up an easier problem like this, solve
the easier problem, then go to a harder one. So he suggested she use one peg on
each side, which she did quickly. Then she got to do 2 pegs on each, but
struggled with 3 on each side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don had, among a myriad of students' works on the
ceiling and walls of the math room,&nbsp; some squares students had divided into
<b>2 congruent pieces</b>. Natalie's Mom borrowed scissors and took some squares
for Natalie to cut.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Time ran out as Natalie picked up the tower
puzzle (see ch. 6), so she borrowed that for the evening; they would be
returning&nbsp; for 2 group sessions in the morning and one in the evening on
Monday. Her Mom had difficulty getting Natalie out the door! ;-)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_________________________________________</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Day 2:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
</b>Monday June 19, 2000 in 3 group sessions (about 2 1/4 hours):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don showed Natalie what squaring a number meant
(3 squared = 3</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>2&nbsp; </sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">=
3x3 = 9 ..) and she knew that 3 - 4 = </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>-</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">1.
The using the rule for substituting- in any one open sentence or equation,
whatever number you put in for one x, you have to put the same number in for all
the x's. Don started her on x</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>2 </sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">-
5x + 6 =0 with the directions, try a small number, positive, no fractions, put
it in for x and try to make the sentence true. (See the sample problems from
chapter 8 for the sequence of quadratic equations Don uses). Natalie proceeded
to find the secrets and solved about 3 quadratic equations fairly quickly. That
evening she made up a quadratic equation for Kelsey, a 9th grader!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don started Natalie off on graphing linear
equations, like 2x+ 3 = y. (See the sample problems from chapter 6 for the
graphing). Natalie saw some patterns: the y-numbers go by 2 as the x-number goes
up by 1; the points go up 2 as you go to the right 1. Then Don asked if there
was a 2 in the equation..sure 2x + 3 = y. Then he asked her what the pattern
would be if the equation was 5x + 3 = y. Natalie, with no hesitation said the
points would go up 5! She proceeded to find pairs of numbers to make this true
and graphed them; and she was right. Her Mom mentioned the adding number.. where
was that on the graph?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At this point Don started using the '5 magic
number cards' with Kelsey and before we knew it all 4 students wanted Don to
guess their number using the number cards. They all used 3x5 cards to copy the 5
number cards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">As Natalie's homework, Don gave her 3 linear
graphs for each of which Natalie was supposed to write an equation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">One thing Don noticed about Natalie, as she
worked on her assignment, she always was looking at and listening to what Don
and other students were working on. She realized she could answer many of Don's
questions he asked other students as well! Of course Don asked her not to say
anything, and she and Don smiled as they shared this silent realization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________________________</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Day 3:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
</b>Tuesday June 20, 2000 in 2 afternoon group sessions (1 1/2 hours):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Natalie had worked with her Mom on the graphing
before she came this afternoon. Natalie had a question about the one graph Don
gave her which had an equation of 1/3 x + 4 = y. It went right 3 and up 1. Don
drew the straight line and showed her that if she went over 1 she would go up an
amount, then over 1 to the right again, and go up the same amount, then go 1
more to the right and go up the same amount again. Going up this last time she
moved&nbsp; up 1 as she moved 3 to the right. She realized she'd have to go over
1 to the right and go up 1/3, so the slope was 1/3. From working with her Mom,
she knew the adding number 4, was where the line crossed the y-axis. When she
wrote the equation, Don had her check a point to see if it's coordinates made
the sentence true, and they did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Natalie worked on the tower puzzle and the peg
game. Then Don, using a protractor and ruler helped Natalie construct a 70
degree spiral. This turns out to be close to the Nautilus shell which is 79.5
degrees.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Day 4:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
</b>Wednesday June 21, 2000 in 2 morning group sessions and 2 evening group
sessions (3 hours):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">While Natalie was working with Don, her mother
was checking out Don's library to see what she would like to get for Natalie.
She even copied a 3 out-of-print books at a local copy shop. She would also come
over to help Natalie sometimes while Don worked with other students. He didn't
mind that at all. Natalie at one point told Don that she was not interested in
the 'pokemon' phenomenon, because it took away time she could spend on math!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don wanted Natalie to have the experience of
graphing parabolas. He started her on x</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">
= y. He drew the axes, but did not number them. He made a table starting with x
= <sup>-</sup>3, <sup>-</sup>2, <sup>-</sup>1, 0 1, 2, and 3. So Don asked her
what&nbsp; <sup>-</sup>3 x <sup>-</sup>3 was and Natalie said 9. So Don did a
pattern in numbers with her:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">2 x <sup>-</sup>3 = <sup>-</sup>6&nbsp; she knew
this</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">1 x <sup>-</sup>3 = <sup>-</sup>3</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">0 x <sup>-</sup>3 = 0&nbsp; no problem. Now Don
asked her &quot;as the first number goes down 1 what happens to the
answer?&quot; She said the answer goes down 3. But When Don drew a number line,
she realized that going from <sup>-</sup>6 to <sup>-</sup>3, goes <b>up </b>3,
and from <sup>-</sup>3 to 0, this goes up 3. So when they continued the pattern,
it was no problem that <sup>-</sup>1 x <sup>-</sup>3 = 3, and <sup>-</sup>2 x <sup>-</sup>3
= 6 and finally for the problem we were looking for <sup>-</sup>3 x <sup>-</sup>3
= 9 ! Then she was able to fill in the y values correctly, and proceeded to
graph the pairs of numbers. Don left her to go to another student and when he
returned, found Natalie had not put the numbers on the axes correctly. The
numbers on the x-axis were in the spaces and she started the y-axis at (<sup>-</sup>2,
0). He corrected this and she plotted the points correctly after that. [Don
realizes that students have to make mistakes before they learn, and there is no
computer program that allows a student to make these mistakes!]</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don then asked her if she saw any patterns: she
saw the y-numbers went 9, 4, 1, 0 , 1, 4, 9. Don showed Natalie that the points
From (0,0) to the right go right 1, up 1, right 1, up 3, right 1, up 5, what
happens next? right 1 up 7, then right 1 up 9..what kind of numbers are these?
1, 3, 5, 7, 9.. odd numbers.. why? Don showed on the graph that 1+3= 4= 2</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2&nbsp;&nbsp;
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">and</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">1+3+5= 9= 3</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">and she wrote</font><sup><font face="Arial" size="1">
</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">1+3+5+7= 16= 4</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2&nbsp;
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">and </font><font face="Arial">Don asked
what the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is, and she said </font><font face="Arial" size="3">10</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">= 100. Don brought out that the
parabola was symmetrical with the y-axis; that is if a mirror was along the
y-axis the right side of the graph would be the mirror image of the left side.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don asked Natalie to move the parabola x</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">
= y up 2 units, then write the equation for the new graph. She suggested&nbsp; x</font><sup><font face="Arial" size="1">2
</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="1"><b>x</b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">
2 = y and proceeded to graph it. She realized that it wasn't going to answer
Don's question because it had the point (0,0) on it not (0,2). <b>Don said that
his question was not as important as seeing what the graph of her equation would
look like. Because what Natalie did was just as important as what Don was going
for. </b>She graphed a few more points and realized that her graph went up
faster than the original; it was skinnier. And the differences were instead of
1, 3, 5, 7, 9,...&nbsp; were 2x1, 2x3, 2x5, 2x7,... that the odd numbers were
still there, but multiplied by 2! Natalie then tried&nbsp; x</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>2
</sup><b>+ </b></font><font face="Arial" size="3">2 = y and that moved the
original graph up 2 units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________________________</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Day 5:</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>
</b>Thursday June 22, 2000 for 1 1/2 hours, an individual session.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don had Natalie graph the partial sums for the
infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... (see chapter 1) and again saw that
the series is approaching 1.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don used a 9x9 square to start Natalie on the
infinite series 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... She got up to 121/243 and started the
graph of the partial sums. She said this was going to 1/2, not what she
predicted on day 1.. Then she predicted 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... would go the
1/3.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_____________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don started Natalie on changing shapes with
matrices ( see sample problems from his book &quot;Changing Shapes With
Matrices&quot;- the book which will be published in Japanese early next
year!).&nbsp; He showed her the grocery-store arithmetic to multiply matrices
and he plotted a 'dog' on graph paper.&nbsp; She chose the 2x2 matrix [-1 0 -1
1] as her transformation matrix. Each point on the dog like [2 1] was then
multiplied by her transformation to obtain a new point and a transformed dog.
They looked at the new dog and Don asked Natalie to describe what happened to
the original dog to get the new dog. <font color="#FF0000">----picture to
come---</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">From the stalk of a sunflower, Don helped Natalie
find the number of leaves that grew in a helix to a point directly above the
starting one (8). Natalie also counted the number of times the leaves went
around the stalk to that point (3). These are both Fibonacci numbers (see
chapter 7). He listed the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, then asked Natalie
to continue. She saw the sequence as adding 2 numbers to get the next one. So
she wrote 1,1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377... Then Don asked
her to get the ratio (comparing by division) of bigger number to smaller 1/1=1,
2/1=2, 3/2 = 1 1/2 = 1.5, 5/3=1 2/3 = 1.666... (Don did this by long division).
Natalie did a couple more and the rest was left for homework.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">_______________________________________</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don gave her Mom the special graph paper for
building the Golden Rectangle and showed her where to place the compasses to
draw the circular arcs and build the new squares (see chapter 7).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Don also gave Mom the special graph paper for
building the snowflake curve and showed her where to start it (see chapter 4).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">At the end of this session they all hugged and
went outside to take some photographs before Natalie and her Mom drove to
Chicago's O'Hare airport.&nbsp; Before leaving, Natalie said, &quot;I will
always remember this week with you.&quot; Natalie's Mom also signed her up for a
month of Don's 'Math By Mail' program, insuring their work together would
continue.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">I'd say try chapter 8 on solving equations with x's on
  both sides, by guessing then balance pictures; solving quadratic equations
  different ways..by iteration &amp; graphing. In chapter 6 graphing conic
  sections in the form x^2 + ky^2 = 25, letting k = 0, 1, 4, -1, -4 and
  exploring these would be good. Does Natalie have a graphing, programmable
  calculator? Something that would be helpful for her to explore lots of things.
  I would start trig using a 12 dot circle.. see the attached file from the new
  section to be added to the Japanese version of &quot;Changing Shapes With
  Matrices&quot;</p>
  Hi Natalie! I hope you continue to do great things in mathematics.<o:p>
  Cordially,Don<br>
  <p>August 21, 2000<br>
  Hi Don, I hope you got my e-mail about <a href="http://www.sodaplay.com/">www.sodaplay.com</a>
  We've just come back from a trip to Europe: I&nbsp;&nbsp; took Natalie to see
  Paris, Rome &amp; Florence; she is jet-lagged and asleep. She hasn't seen your
  parcel yet. Thank you very much for the book. (Don sent Natalie the book 'Women
  in Numbers'; by Teri Perl; Wide World Publishing/Tetra; 1997)</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Natalie
  made a problem for you while we were in Rome. We walked down the street and
  suddenly she asked: &quot;The snail is climbing out of the aquarium with a<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
  </span>height&nbsp; a little over 1 foot. 1st day she climbs up 1 foot and
  falls down 0.5 foot, 2nd day - she climbs up 0.5 feet and falls down 0.25
  foot, 3rd - she climbs up 0.25 foot and falls down 0.125 foot and so on. Will
  snail ever get out of aquarium?&quot;<o:p>
  We didn't do lots of math on a trip. She learnt a new number trick on a plane
  (guessing numbers between 1 to 60). Also we were in Florence in the museum of
  history of science and I explained to her how you can measure height of tall
  buildings ( in the museum they had instruments where ratios in triangles were
  used, or thru tangents).</p>
  I have lots of things to figure out within couple of days. Also, forgot: we
  did graphing of 1/x=y. She predicted that -1/x=y is going to be symmetrical
  but hasn't tried yet.
  <p>Don's response August 22, 2000: Have Natalie move the hyperbola up 2
  units, write the equation..right 3 units, write the equation.. Like we did
  with the parabola. I don't think the snail will get out of the aquarium
  because the sum of this infinite series is 1, not quite high enough to get
  out. What do you think Natalie?</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">.. I'll copy &quot;the pentagon&quot; work that we did
  with Natalie on Tuesday. Prior to that she draw a golden spiral by plotting
  Fibonacci number rectangles (p. 132). She liked the pentagon problem very
  much.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Natalya</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">10/23/00 Don received a copy of the work Natalie and Mom
  did on p. 136 of Don's worksheet book and a check to continue Math By
  Mail/Email with Don.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">10/24/00 Don's response to Natalie:<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Hi Natalie,<br>
  <br>
  Good job on p. 136 in my worksheet book!&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Yes there are 3 <b>different size angles</b>: 36, 72 and 108 degrees. Each
  triangle is an isosceles triangle.. 2 sides equal. And yes, there are 2 <b>different
  shaped triangles</b>. There are smaller and larger of the same shape..these
  are called similar triangles. [See also p. 105 and you can try the 'eye test'
  to see that 2 chambers of the Nautilus are similar. And try a 3x5 card and do
  the 'eye test to see what other objects, like books, are the same shape as the
  3x5 card. The 3x5 card is close to the golden mean because 5/3 = 1.66... and
  when you made the golden rectangle, p.132, notice that one of those rectangles
  is 3x5 !]<br>
  <br>
  There are 4 <b>different size segments</b>..I didn't see the diagonal of the
  pentagon marked. The ratio of the diagonal (57 mm)/side of the pentagon (35
  mm) = 1.6285714.. and Mom got 35/22= 1.59 . With errors in measurement
  (always), these are very close to 1.61803... which is the golden mean (I use
  the Greek letter phi for that number). On p. 137 if GH is called 1, then CH is
  phi. Try naming the other segments in terms of phi.<br>
  <br>
  Good to talk to you Natalie!!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">From Natalie, January 5, 2001, along with a copy of
  &quot;The Number Devil&quot;: &quot;Dear Mr. Don Cohen, here is a math and new
  year poem for you:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Happy New Year to you,</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Happy New Year to you!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You teach like a number devil</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">And you do math like one too!! &quot; Natalie (nearly)
  age 8. Natalie is starting to prove theorems.</p>

Don had some word problems that involved ratios. He        started Sara with this problem (from Dolciani):<br>        <br>        <br>        In a dry Concrete mixture the ratio Sand to Cement is 4:1 and the ratio        of Gravel to Sand is 5:4. How many pounds of each are in 1100 pounds of        the Concrete?<br>        <br>        Sara wrote the ratios as 5:4:1, then proceeded to multiply each of these        by some number she chose, say 50 to get 250:200:50 then added these to        get 250+200+50 = 500, which is less than the 1100 lbs. needed. Sara        continued this to eventually she multiplied each by 110 to get        550+440+110 = 1100 lbs.<br>        which was the correct total. So there was 550 lbs. of Gravel, 440 lbs.        of sand, and 110 lbs. of cement in the 1100 lbs of Concrete.<br>        <br>        Then Don showed Sara how he did it using algebra: Let x equal the        multiplying number, so he got 5x+4x+1x=1100 and 10x=1100, so x=110, and        the weight of each would be 5*110 + 4*110+ 1*110= 1100 lbs. of concrete.<br>        <br>        Then Don asked Sara 'Suppose the ratio of Sand to Cement was 3:1 instead        of 4:1 and the ratio of Gravel to Sand was 5:4. Instead of 5:4:1 we have        5:4 and 3:1. How would you do that?'<br>        <br>        Immediately Sara suggested we use the lowest common multiple of 4 and 3,        or 12, to get the ratios 5*3:4*3 and 3*4:1*4 and ended up with 15:12:4.        Then she calculated the multiplying number to be 35+15/31 which was        1100/31. She then multiplied each of the numbers 15, 12, and 4, by        35+15/31 and added them, to get 15*(35+15/31) [lbs. of Gravel] +        12*(35+15/31) [lbs. of sand] + 4*(35+15/31) [lbs. of cement]= 1100 lbs.        of concrete, which was correct!<br>        <br>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fine work, Sara!!!</span></p>  </body></html>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>Dear Don,<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">I just finished writing a book
with the title, '</font><b><font face="Arial" size="4">Journey from Kilimanjaro</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3">'.
It is autobiographical about my life in Africa and San Francisco as a traveler
and a teacher. One chapter has the title, 'A Mathematical Expedition', and I
refer to you in the chapter. The book is available at Amazon.com and Barnes and
Noble (bn.com). Below is this chapter: </o:p>

 Mathematical Expedition</b><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'We struggle for high school
students to learn algebra when elementary school students are capable of
learning calculus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why is it not
our mission that the most highly skilled and understanding teaching force be
available in the classroom?<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">I sometimes find life in
elementary school classrooms profoundly interesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My wife is teaching summer school again, and I am the math teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Several years ago I visited a public housing resident (Theresa Coleman)
and I found a fascinating book in her overcrowded dwelling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is about teaching calculus to kindergartners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How surprised I was that it was there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I ask to borrow the book and reluctantly she agrees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I give her my word that I shall return it in a week.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The concept is powerful and
engaging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am glad to read and to
study it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When my wife invites me
to teach the math class, the idea is still in me about teaching calculus to
young children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I search the
information highway and I find material on teaching calculus to the young.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I communicate with Don Cohen who wrote the material for '<i>Calculus By
and For Young People</i>' and had been using it for seventeen years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He talks with me, and I am impressed with his materials and his ideas on
learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I start with a lesson on
the sum and convergence of an infinite sequence on the first day.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a fascinating adventure that involves all of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The class each day is intense and demanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The students work hard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
learn to use calculators and computers in new ways and to diligently study the
partial sums as they endlessly merge, crowding toward a point.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">One day in class a black girl who
is struggling with infinite repeating decimals asks why we are doing this
college work in elementary school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
is the only one who voices such a concern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The others work on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What I
tell the class is that we are working problems that are sometimes difficult to
grasp and understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
important to know that playing, studying, laughing, being good, and doing
difficult things are all a part of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
we do not work on hard things, read books, or see the beauty in a leaf, we are
not really living.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I tell them to
take school and education seriously and to learn, new, difficult, and demanding
things as we go through life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
important that they do.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">The students are nine and
ten-years-old and will be going into the fourth and fifth grades next school
year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The class is mostly Black and
Chinese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are two White
students and one Latino.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think it
is quite possible for four or five students to master such concepts of calculus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deep goal is to have all of the students in the class participating
and learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are thirty
students in the class, and my mission is to have every soul here moving deeper
into mathematics than they ever thought possible.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">One student is from China and
cannot speak English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She grasps
the math with much more certainty than the English.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She does all the work that everyone else does and does it as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Others help her with her
English, which is significantly improving, sometimes daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She is a new immigrant with a deep personal mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are two special education students who started slowly but stay with
the problems and learning process and gain strength in the subject and in this
world we all form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One student,
Lawrence, can see deeper than others into problems and can comprehend abstract
and novel situations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is good
that he is here because there seems to be no ideas beyond his understanding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is often his insight and understanding that ignites the class and
excites their thinking. Some things make us question our capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other things deeply transform and move us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are also many students who struggle with multiplication,
subtraction, and division.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
division algorithm is too complicated for many to master so we view division in
other ways such as subtracting quantities that are contained within other
quantities and sometimes discover new ways to understand our results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fractions, decimals, addition, and division are not isolated exercises
but are used in determining the limit of an infinite set of partial sums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is important that we learn what we can now, no matter how we got to
where we are.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Calculus is a collection of
thoughts, objects, and symbols closed in a system of descriptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>New methods and streams of descriptions come into our consciousness,
bringing a hint of the real world, revealing it through symbolic form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One day I would like for us to drop and propel objects and to understand
their displacement in space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
can show us that this mathematics does work in the real world.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">Some students do not become deeply
involved in learning because of social and academic inequality from tracking,
segregations, a diminished curriculum, and negative categorizing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This mathematics class where we all worked hard, profoundly challenged
and changed us all.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We find learning, discovery, and understanding, which
connects each of us to a larger world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
all live diminished lives when the environments that we exist in do not
challenge and deepen our capabilities'.<o:p>

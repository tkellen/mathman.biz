&quot;Calculus By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot;, was done in

I finally have your book in my hand! (Hiroshi attached a picture of himself
holding my book in his hand) It is a first step for many people to learn
your way of teaching. Thank you for you and your math teaching. I will continue
to show your thought into our culture.<br>

Hi Don, .. I bought the translation of your book today in a small bookstore near
my house. The translation is also excellent. I teach calculus, statistics, and
geometry etc to about 400 students in a week. They are 16 years old to 20 years
old. I will recommend all of them to buy your book. Best regards, Shigeru<br>

<p>Aug. 22, 1998 Hi Don, Congratulations! I bought your book today. I have read
only chapter 1 and 2, but I can say that its translation is plain and good. I
enjoy it. My son is eight years old. I will try your book with him.<br>
I'll change my homepage to encourage people to buy and enjoy your book.

I have recently bought your book of Japanese version at Akasaka, Tokyo.
Congratulation for your book (Japanese edition) coming out in Japan. By the way,
I have been reading books by W.W. Sawyer for the past 20 years. The reason why I
started to read Sayers books is that I had not understood Math at all in the
past. The book by you is very close sense to Sawyer, I am very happy to find
your book at a bookstore. I want to ask you a favor. How can I get a English
version of this Calculus by and for young people. I would appreciate it if you
would advise it to me. Thank you for now. Hideo Okada<br>

<p>Sept. 5, 1998 Yuichi Nishiya e-mail address: u1248@host.or.jp How are you
,Don? My name is Yuichi Nishiya. I teach Math. at IAI GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL in
HAKODATE HOKKAIDO JAPAN,and have 2 sons of 6 and 11 years' old. I've read your
book (kodansha) just now.,and feel to send you e-mail rigjt now. Your math
program is very interesting. Ihave same idea that even seven years' old kids can
understand the concept of sequences and series.The most important thing is to
let the kids feel the essence of math concepts by the method of finding it by
themselves. I hope you to enjoy yourself by teaching kids. Good-bye!<br>

<p>Sept. 6, 1998 From Kodansha<br>
And now I have good news to tell you. We are going to print additional 2,000
copies late this month. We can say that your method was accepted to Japanese
people as a kind of new text in which they could learn and understand math much
more than ever before.

Hi, Don!<br>
My name is Yoshiaki Ueno, and I am writing to you for the first time. I am a
math teacher at a university near Tokyo. I am using Mathematica both in teaching
and researching. Congratulations! Your book &quot;Calculus by and for young
people&quot; has just translated into Japanese and published by Kodansha. I
purchased a copy of it. I am really enjoying reading it.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>On 10/14/2000</b> Don received an email and had the following
discussion:
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hello.<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Cohei Masuda. i am a Japanese professional
school student.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;i read the Japanese translation of your book
&quot;Calculus By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot;. i am
interested in your book because i study Calculus at school.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">May i ask you a question about your book? Can you tell me
what Ian (i don't know spelling of his name, but i remember he's genius) did
when he calculated space of under the graph (y=1/x). Could he calculate
it?&nbsp; I'd like to know how he did. i expect you respond to my question.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Don's response to Cohei:</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hi Cohei,<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading my book.<br>
<br>
It was not Ian who did that; I used the program I wrote on the calculator to
plot points under curves. (See pages 120, 121 and 122 in your book). I may have
shown Ian the program and we used it to find the area under the curve y = 1/x
from x=1 to x=3 which came out about 1.0952. The log 3 (base e) = 1.0986, very
close!<br>
<br>
I hope this is helpful to you.<br>
<br>
Cordially, Don</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i am happy because you respond to my question.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Incidentally, i wrote a program for Harmonic Series in C
language. Just for reference your information, here are it:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;#include&nbsp;&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;main()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;double n,i,sum;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sum=0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf(&quot;n=&quot;);scanf(&quot;%lf&quot;,&amp;n);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for(i=2;i&lt;=n+1;i++)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum=sum+1/i;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf(&quot;sum(%.0lf)=%.15lf\n&quot;,n,sum);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return(0);<br>

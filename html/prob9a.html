For about 35 years my students and I looked at these numbers and found 
many patterns. For example if you add two numbers in a row, like 4+6, you 
get the number below the 6 in the  in the next row, 10. Looking down 
column #2, 1,3 6 10 ... They go up 2, then 3 (to get 6), then 4 (to get 
10), and so on. So you can predict the number below 10 in the next row. 
And you can find a rule for each column. What we'd like to do is to be 
able to find the 8th number in the 20th row, though. What Ian did was 
something 
special, and enabled one to do this. Ian did this at age 12. Newton did a 
similar thing when he was 
19, according to W.W. Sawyer in "Integrated Mathematics Scheme- Book C". 
I just happened to receive this book from England about a week after Ian 
did his thing. In Ian's words:<p>

"I was faced with the problem of generating Pascal's triangle. I decided 
to start looking at patterns until I found one that applied to the 
entire triangle. After some trial and error, I noticed a pattern in the 
ratios from one column to the next. In row 4, for example, the ratios 
are arrived at by asking,<br>what times 1 = 4?<img align=middle

 <img align=middle src="../images/ian6432.gif" width="41" height="26"> Then
<img align=middle src="../images/ian4623.gif" width="41" height="25"> And

To get the 8th number in the 20th row:<br>

Ian switched from the 'number in the row' to 'the column number'. Since 
the columns start with the 0th column, his x is one less than the number 
in the row, for example, the 3rd number is in column #2. In other words 
just subtract 1 first, from the number in the row and use that as 
x.<br>Notice that
 <img src="../images/20!.gif" width="564" height="280"><br>And the general term, the number in 
the xth column, in the nth row, of the 
binomial expansion <sup> <img align=middle src="../images/abn.gif" width="62" height="21"> </sup>is 
<sup><img 
align=middle src="../images/genabn.gif" width="132" height="35"></sup><br>We go on to show how this 
is used to find (1 - x)<sup><font size=-1>-1</font></sup> and later in 
chapter 10 to 
find the square root of 2, and later still in ch. 11 to find compound 
interest and <b>e</b>.<hr>

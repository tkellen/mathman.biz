<p class="MsoNormal">Robyn's emails and Don's responses</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">12/18/00 from Robyn Kozierok (&nbsp;email: <a href="mailto:robynk@shore.net">robynk@shore.net</a>
)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I wonder if you still remember me.&nbsp; I was thinking
about ways of working with kids in a public school setting using your
materials.&nbsp; My main motivation was my own 7yo son Ryan, whom I knew would
enjoy doing it,but who might be reluctant to do additional academic stuff after
spending 7 hours a day in school.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>So I volunteered to take a handful of kids from
my son's K-3 class one morning a week and do some &quot;math enrichment&quot;
with them.&nbsp; I didn't use the &quot;c&quot; word as I think it makes
grownups nervous. :)&nbsp; So I have 7 kids, 1st thru 3rd grades (mostly 2nd)
for 75 minutes once a week.&nbsp; The teachers are pleased to have a chance to
do review with the remaining kids without boring these guys, and I am pleased
that these guys don't have to sit through the unnecessary-for-them review.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 I will tell you up front that I am doing this with no budget, so I won't be
able to engage your consulting services or come for a visit, purchase additional
workbooks etc. (I already own 1 full set of your materials.)&nbsp; So the rest
of this is just FYI in case you are interested in what we are doing and how it
is working out.&nbsp; But feel free to delete it if you don't have the time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>

 I've seen them 3 times and so far we are having fun.&nbsp; The first two times
I didn't really do the calculus activities, but tried to get them &quot;warmed
up&quot; -- they played math games and we did some exploring with fractions and
cuisenaire rods and playing with towers of Hanoi.&nbsp; Last week I had several
of them working on cookie sharing.&nbsp; A few tried to find the pattern for the
towers of Hanoi, but didn't get very far.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ryan, who had done one cookie sharing problem at home, did
a different one and also did 1/2 + 1/4 + ...&nbsp; Most of the kids who did the
cookie sharing had a lot of trouble figuring out the fraction names for their
various pieces.&nbsp; A few times I had to ask kids to start over and show me
what they'd done because they had a pile of different sized pieces in front of
them with no idea how big they were. :)&nbsp; I was surprised by the number of
different ways they did the cookie problem.&nbsp; We did 5 cookies and 3
kids.&nbsp; First using the non-special scissors.&nbsp; Ryan gave each kid a
whole cookie, cut the other two in thirds, and gave each person 2/3.&nbsp; I
couldn't imagine that anyone would do it any other way, but I saw 1 + 1/2 +
1/6,&nbsp;&nbsp; 3/2 + 2/3,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I have one first-grader on her way
to 3/2 + 4/24&nbsp; (boy did we work hard to figure out what to name *those*
pieces!)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 I think 7 is larger than the optimal size for the group, but I don't want to
turn anyone away.&nbsp; I have been trying to get them to work together
sometimes to figure stuff out.&nbsp; But these are kids who are used to
everything coming easy to them, and they tend to just want me to tell them the
answers.&nbsp; I am still working out the right level of hand-holding and
leading them versus letting/making them discover things on their own.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 Anyhow, thought you might be interested to hear what we are up to out here in
Vermont with your stuff.&nbsp; I have a math background and have&nbsp; a true
passion for this kind of stuff, and it is great seeing some of that spark in the
eyes of young kids.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Robyn,<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On this, my 15th post-Prostate-surgery day, I really thank
you SOOOOOO much for writing about your experiences with my materials. Until
your response I had no desire to answer any of my email.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 My first thoughts: <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. I'm glad to hear you and the kids are enjoying your
experiences. (Sound like you are doing a fine job!)<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. Your listening and helping the kids find names for their
fractions is the hardest part, but most rewarding.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. I would offer a discount to parents who would want to
purchase my worksheet book, for example. I probably should give you a rebate.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. Don't worry about them seeing a pattern in the Tower
Puzzle- start with 2 disks? work up?<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. Yes, for math, even bright youngsters are used to being
given the answers.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. May I use your comments on my web page? If you want I
will use or not use your last name as you desire. May I include your email
address?<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 Robyn, please feel free to call anytime!<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 Thank you for telling me what you're doing. Have a fine New Year!<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cordially, Don</p>

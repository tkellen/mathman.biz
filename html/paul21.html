<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;I started Paul with the problem</font> <img border="0" src="../images/paul21.gif" width="43" height="44" align="absmiddle"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;(See the copy of the page from his book below. This
problem is down near his art work), which&nbsp; means how many quarters make
one-half? Like in the problem 12&nbsp; divided by 3 = ? Or what times 3 makes
12? We worked our way up the page, and he caught on to the pattern. I asked him
to make up some problems like these. This is where the interesting part comes
in! He starts to divide by zero!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">We discussed 3/0 = ? as what times 0 = 3? And he said
there is no number times 0 = 3. His notation was N.A. for no answer. The we
talked about 0/5 = ? What times 5 = 0? and of course this was 0. What about
0/0=? and he came up with the fact that any number times 0 = 0. So 0/0= Any
Number (A.N.); this is equivalent to AN x 0 = 0.</font></p>

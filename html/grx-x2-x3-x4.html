<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Geoffrey had figured out the rule for the shuttle
puzzle P(P+2)=M, and Don asked him to graph this function as x(x+2)=y. He got a
parabola. They looked at the pattern in the parabola- from (0,0) it goes 1
right, 1 up, 1 right then 3 up, 1 right then 5 up, and continued going up the
odd numbers. Don then asked Geoffrey to graph x = y,&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> =
y,&nbsp; x<sup>3</sup> = y, and&nbsp; x<sup>4</sup> = y from x = <sup>-</sup>1
to 1 by .1's, on the same graph paper. He did this below:</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/geoffgrs.jpg" width="467" height="477"></p>
<p align="left">Then Don asked him to write about what he found in the graphs.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;When x is negative and y = x raised to an odd power, both
x and y are negative because if you multiply <font face="Arial" size="3"><sup>-</sup></font>.9
by <font face="Arial" size="3"><sup>-</sup></font>.9 by <font face="Arial" size="3"><sup>-</sup></font>.9
you have to get a negative number because a negative times a negative is a
positive , and a negative times a positive is a negative.</p>
<p align="left">When <font face="Arial" size="3">x<sup>4 </sup>=y the graph
looks more like half a square because when you multiply a number between 0 and 1
and you make it to the fourth power it gets much smaller because it's kind of
like dividing because .1<sup>2</sup>=.1 x .1=.01&quot;.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Geoffrey worked on moving the

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Geoffrey has been working on the <font color="#FF0000"><b>
SSAT test off and on, getting ready for the test next year for University HS</b></font>. Don showed Geoffrey
how to multiply 12x13 in his head, and ended up multiplying 22x23 in his head.
Don also showed geoffrey how to square 2 numbers the end in 5, like 25x25
=&nbsp; ?&nbsp; Well the answer has a 25 on the right&nbsp; _ 2 5 . Take the
other number 2, add 1, to get 3, then multiply by 2 by 3 to get 6. The answer to
25x25 = 625. In the process of doing something in school he talked about 5<sup>8</sup>
= 625<sup>2</sup> and he proceeded to multiply 625x625 in his head!</font></p>

parabola</font></b>
<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#800080">&nbsp;that is moved</font></b>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Don went through the multiplication
of&nbsp; negative numbers with Sheri because she needed that idea to do the
graph. On a number line Don made sure Sheri understood that as one goes from <sup>-</sup>2
to <sup>-</sup>1 that is going <b>up</b> 1.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sheripat.jpg" width="341" height="199"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Sheri realized from the patterns that&nbsp; (<sup>-</sup>3)</font><font size="1"><sup><sup><b>2</b></sup></sup></font><font size="3">
= <sup>+</sup>9 = 9. Sheri graphed the equation y = x</font><font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font><sup><font size="2">
</font></sup><font size="3">(in mulberry, below). After she graphed y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>2</b>&nbsp;
</sup></font><font size="3">, Don had her look at how the graph goes up from
(0,0) - go 1 to the right you go up 1, 1 to the right you go up 3, 1 to the right
you go up 5, 7, 9 etc. The parabola goes up odd numbers! Don asked her to find
the equation of the parabola if this original parabola is moved <b>up </b>2
units. Her answers were y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>3</b>&nbsp; </sup></font><font size="3">and
y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>2</b> </sup></font><font size="3">+ 2. (It turned
out that the second answer was arrived at talking with Mom). Sheri proceeded
to graph y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>3</b> </sup></font><font size="3">next. In
this process Sheri and Don worked on (<sup>-</sup>3)</font><font size="1"><sup><sup><b>3</b></sup></sup></font><font size="3">=
<sup>-</sup>3 </font><font size="2"><b><sup>x</sup></b></font><font size="3"> <sup>-</sup>3
</font><font size="2"><b><sup>x</sup></b></font><font size="3"> <sup>-</sup>3 = <sup>-</sup>27.
Sheri found that &quot;a negative number raised to an odd power is negative and
a negative number raised to an even power is positive&quot;. (<sup>-</sup>3)</font><font size="1"><sup><sup><b>4</b></sup></sup></font><font size="3">=
<sup>-</sup>3 </font><font size="2"><b><sup>x</sup></b></font><font size="3"> <sup>-</sup>3
</font><font size="2"><b><sup>x</sup></b></font><font size="3"> <sup>-</sup>3 </font><font size="2"><b><sup>x</sup></b></font><font size="3">
<sup>-</sup>3 = 81. They also talked about (<sup>-</sup>3)</font><font size="1"><sup><sup>4
</sup></sup></font><font size="3">is <b>not</b> the same as <sup>-</sup>(3</font><font size="1"><sup><sup><b>4</b></sup></sup></font><font size="3">).
T he graph of y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </sup></font><font size="3">is
the blue graph and <b>not</b> a parabola. Then Sheri graphed y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>2</b>
</sup></font><font size="3">+ 2 (in red), which moved the parabola <b>up</b> 2
units. Then Don gave Sheri the problem of moving the original parabola <b>to the
right</b> <b>3 units</b> (light green). The equation she gave for this was y = x</font><font size="1"><sup><b>2</b>
</sup></font><font size="5"><sup>.</sup></font><font size="3"> 3. (Now a very
important idea here is that even if Sheri's equation is not correct,<b> her
equation will give a graph that will be important, and do something different</b>).
Look at the graphs below- this one is in neon pink.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sheriparab.jpg" width="402" height="535"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">So Sheri's equation gave a graph that made the
original one skinnier! She immediately said if you divide, the graph will be
wider (the yellow one) and of course she was right. She didn't get the equation
to move the graph to the right yet, but she did a fine job and learned lots
about signed numbers and raising them to a power!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In trying to move the parabola to the right 3
units, Don and Sheri made the following table:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sheriparab2.jpg" width="209" height="231"></p>
<p align="left">They talked about how the numbers in the third column are
different from those for the <font size="3">x</font><sup><font size="1"><b>2</b> </font></sup><font size="3">values.
Sheri said they are the same, square numbers, but moved down. What do we have to
do to get 3 to go to 9? Subtract 3. So the new rule would be as Sheri wrote in
green, (x - 3)<sup>2 </sup>= y. This is the hardest one to get, because you have
to subtract before squaring.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#800080">Perimeter of Rectangles with
Area of 36/Chapter 14</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Maya, just 9 years old, made
rectangles whose area was 36. She started with the 4x9 rectangle. Don tried to
show her that without counting all the squares, she could multiply 4x9=36, 4
rows of 9=36 to get the area. What was the perimeter? Again she counted around the outside, and
started counting the corner squares. Don suggested she just add 9 + 9 + 4
+ 4 = 26. After that she added the lengths of the sides. She continued on and
Don had her do the 9x4 rectangle as well as the 4x9, keeping the length as the
horizontal side.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/PerofrectA1=36.jpg" width="648" height="834"></p>
<p align="left">The talked about factors of 36 and when she was finished, she
had them all. Then Don suggested they graph the length vs Perimeter. Don made the axes to show the length on the horizontal
axis, and the perimeter on the vertical axis. They talked about fitting tthe
largest length, 36 on the horizontal axis- it just fit. The perimeter on the
vertical axis had to go up to 74, which wouldn't fit if each square was 1 unit.
Don helped Maya get to 2 units per square, which fit nicely. Maya helped count
up by tens to get to 70, then 74, the biggest perimeter. Since the numbers were
on a different sheet, Don made the table of pairs of number that we were going
to plot on the graph paper. For length 1, the perimeter was 74, so Maya plotted the point at
(1,74). She continued the rest, with Don keeping careful track, because she had
to make sure she counted 2 units&nbsp; for each square; it was a little
difficult because she also had to go across the paper for the vertical distance. At
one point Don got a ruler to help her go across. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/PerofrectA2=36.jpg" width="660" height="838"></p>
<p align="left">At the end, Don asked her what was the length of the rectangle
which had the smallest perimeter. She looked at the graph and said 6, the
square! Don brought her work upstairs to show her Mom.</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">Fine job Maya!</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">After they left,&nbsp; Don
proceeded to show mathematically that this point (6,24) was a minimum point. He found
the
equation of the curve of P in terms of L, this way:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A=L*W = 36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font>divide by L to get</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; W = 36/L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="center">and P = 2*L + 2*W . Substituting 36/L for W, we get rid of W,
and</p>

<p align="center">P = 2*L + 2*36/L =</p>

  <b><font color="#000080"> </font><font color="#800080">P = 2*L + 72/L </font></b>,</p>

  <p align="center">which gives the perimeter in terms of the length of the
  rectangle.&nbsp; </p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Now he took the derivative of P
(found the slope of the tangent to the curve), then set that equal to zero,
because when the derivative is zero, we get a horizontal tangent and a
maximum/minimum point.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Now take the derivative of P (call it P'). The
  derivative/slope of the tangent of 2L = <font color="#008000"><b>2</b></font>.
  The&nbsp; derivative of 72/L (or 72*L<sup>-</sup><b><sup><font size="1">1 </font></sup></b><font size="3">)<b>

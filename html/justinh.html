<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Valerie, you 
and Justin are doing fine.
The Magic number in base 3 looks fine.<br>
<br>
One comment about writing down the numbers for say, the square root of 2 (see p. 
A211)..I would recommend writing down the guesses like this (getting the numbers 
to the nearest tenth, hundredth, thousandth...) narrowing down the answer. <br>
<br>
Too big -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.42,&nbsp; 1.415 , ...<br>
<br>
Too small -&gt; 1,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.41,&nbsp; 1.414 , ...<br>
<br>
then one can see that you are getting 2 infinite sequences, each approaches the 
square root of 2, one from below, the other from above. You can even square the 
number to see if you get 2. The danger of this is that the calculator will say 2 
at some point because it will round off. If you use <i>Derive</i> or <i>
Mathematica, </i>going out more places, you will see that you never get to 2.<br>
<br>
The graphs look fine (why not use copies of the 1/2&quot; graph paper in the 
appendix?) Don't forget to have him get two numbers for points in-between whole 
numbers, like </span></b>
<br><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">(4 1/2, 1 
1/2). Slope and intercept are important, that's great. Does he see the patterns 
in the graphs for 2x + 3 = y and&nbsp; 2x + 5 = y, and&nbsp; 5x + 3 = y ? Have him make up 
a graph for me to figure out the equation. Always do things forward as well as 
backward! I use 2x+3=y because in the table of numbers we write (x,y) and the x 
here comes first.<br>
<br>
I like the way you are using the calculator for finding the square root of 1000.<br>
<br>
Attached is one way I help kids do the decimals - if the large square (100 
little squares) is 0ne (1), then what is the 1x10 strip?, what is one little 
square? Of course you can use money as well. Using the square and strips I get 
them to multiply 12x13 in their heads.<br>
<br>
Keep up the fine work, Valerie and Justin!

looking a bit at solving some of the equations from your book.&nbsp; I was hoping to 
tie it into the �solving by guessing� work we�d done on square roots, but Justin 
mostly wanted to �think� about each equation to come up with the answer.&nbsp; He did 
have trouble when he incorrectly figured 17 � 5 = 11 and came up with �3 
remainder 2� for the answer (actually 9 remainder 2 as he knew 3 x 3 was the 
biggest multiple of 3 that he could get out of 11 and used the 9 instead of the 
3).&nbsp; We were able to see that 9 didn�t make much sense and guessed 3 and then 4

blocks and in the case of the second problem added the 12 invisible blocks to 
the 170 mentally.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008000; font-weight: 700">Justin does 
multiplication problems daily but relies heavily on look-up tables as he does 
not have the facts memorized.&nbsp; I thought it might be helpful to show him that he 
could visualize smaller rectangles to solve single digit problems.&nbsp; We 
introduced a 5 x 5 square made up of 25 blocks, and he was able to solve 
problems such as 5 x 5, 7 x 5, 6 x 8, 5 x 8, 6 x 8, and 7 x 8.&nbsp; We checked his 
answers using his look-up table.&nbsp; I�m not sure if he understood why we switched 
from the 10 x 10 square to the 5 x 5 square and wasn�t as impressed with being 
able to solve the �easy� problems.&nbsp; We attempted a 3 x 3 square, but he wasn�t 
strong enough in skip counting by 3�s and had lost interest in the method (or 
gotten confused by the different sized squares?).</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008000; font-weight: 700">We worked 
with the 100�s square to understand decimals.&nbsp; I tried to show him the place 
values for the decimals � tenths, hundredths, thousandths�&nbsp; He then colored in 
squares to <span class="grame">represent&nbsp; 0.1</span>, 0.01, 0.001, 0.2, 0.04, 
and 0.14.&nbsp; Then, based on your recommendation of doing things forwards and 
backwards, I suggested he color in squares and let me guess the decimal.&nbsp; He 
colored in 0.06 (with one block down in the far corner!) and then tried to stump 
me with 0.0011 (one-ninth of a square) and 0.0308 (3 squares plus one-twelfth of 
a square).&nbsp; I�d like to try tomorrow to color squares and see if he can supply 
the decimal.&nbsp; He still seems a bit shaky on the idea that 10 hundredths is the 
same as 1 tenth or being able to identify when a number is tenths or hundredths, 
but the exercise seemed to help his overall concept of decimals.</span></p>

I really appreciate all the great ideas you�re giving me.&nbsp; It is nice to have 
more things to do with Justin than we�ve got time to do!&nbsp; So often I feel like 
I�m running out of new and interesting things to work on with him.&nbsp; I�m not 
ignoring the </span><span style="font-family:Arial;
  color:green">Ch.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green"> 1 and Ch. 
2 exercises � just not sure where else to go with them beyond what we�ve done.&nbsp; 
Here�s a summary of some of the work we did previously.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Chapter 1 � 
Justin shaded in each fraction in the series � + � + 1/8 + � (Justinold0001).&nbsp; 
He was able to see that he�d never have the whole �cake� but that it would get 
very close to 1.&nbsp; We also came up with the total fraction of cake shaded in each 
step and graphed the totals on a cake to show that they approached 1.&nbsp; </span>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Chapter 2 � 
Justin used 5 cards and tried to share them between 3 people.&nbsp; He gave each 
person 1 and cut the rest in �.&nbsp; He gave each 1 of the new pieces and had 1 
left.&nbsp; He cut that one in half and seeing that he still didn�t have 3 then cut 
each of the strips into 3 pieces.&nbsp; We figured out that each had 1 + 8/12 (by 
dividing all the pieces into twelfths).&nbsp; We talked about 8/12 = 2/3.&nbsp; We divided 
out 2/3 using long division and found an infinite series to Justin�s delight!&nbsp; 
We also reworked the original problem dividing 5 cards between 3 and kept 
cutting each piece in two.&nbsp; He saw that it the problem became an infinite 
series.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Chapter 4 � 
Justin drew the snowflake curve Justinold0002).&nbsp; We discussed that each side was 
1/3 of the last and practiced dividing by 3.&nbsp; We did not cover the ratios of 
perimeter or area.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Chapter 5 � 
Justin shaded in squares for the [harmonic series] &nbsp;� + 1/3 + � + 1/5 � 
(Justinold0003).&nbsp; We ran out of the first �cake� and added a second.&nbsp; He saw 
that we would keep needing more cake.&nbsp; We talked about how some series converge 
and some diverge.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Chapter 6 � 
Justin and I both spent several days creating function machines for each other 
and anyone else who would play (Justinold0004).&nbsp; We looked at the graphing and 
saw how making a small change (2x + 3, 2x + 1, 2x + 7) affected the graph 
(Justinold0005). &nbsp;He was able to complete page Q93.&nbsp; We also built and played 
with a Peg and Tower puzzle.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Here�s 
today�s work:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">
Justin01080001 � I colored in squares on the 100-square chart and Justin wrote 
down the corresponding decimals (he had an easier time saying the correct 
fraction than figuring out how to write what he said).&nbsp; We threw in a few tough 
ones at the end!&nbsp; Justin and I talked about how � of a dollar is like $.50, � is 
like $.75, and � of a dollar is like $.25.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">
Justin01080002 �&nbsp; We worked on finding the square-root of 2 using a calculator 
to check guesses and took it out to the ten-thousandths place (1.4142�).&nbsp; We 
also calculated on the computer to see that it would keep going (at least as far 
as we could tell).</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">
Justin01080003 �&nbsp; Justin came up with a function for me which I wanted him to 
graph (Justin01080004).&nbsp; His function was �divide by 2 minus 2� but he had a 
little trouble calculating the output for me.&nbsp; We reworked the answers together 
to get the x/2 � 2 = y graph.&nbsp; He made one more for me (3x + 3) and was 
delighted when I guessed it based on the graph.</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">Thank you 
again for all your suggestions and ideas.&nbsp; I�m always looking for where to 
go next! Valerie&quot;</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial"><b><font size="4">8 January,</font><span style="color:green"> 
Don to Valerie: </span></b></span><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:green">�Valerie, 
you just never told me about ch 1 work, at least that I remember!&nbsp;
&quot;Justin shaded in each fraction in the series � + � + 1/8 + � &quot; did he look at 
the partial sums? Did he graph the partial sums? Next try 1/3 + (1/3)^2 + ... 
(make the square 9x9 to start).&nbsp; I'd like to see if he could generalize � + � + 
1/8 + � -&gt;1 and&nbsp; 1/3 + (1/3)^2 + ...&nbsp; -&gt; ? and 1/4+(1/4)^2 + (1/4)^3 + ...-&gt; ?&nbsp; 
to 1/n + (1/n)^2 + ... -&gt; ? and (a/b) + (a/b)^2 + (a/b)^3 + ... -&gt; ? But only 
you can see when he's ready. Then problems in ch. 1 can be done, as well as the 
snowflake curve!.<br>
<br>
On the cookies 2 things, it's important to get him to name the pieces and you 
could get track of how many each person gets. So for 5 C, 3 P each person got 1, 
then each person had 1 + 1/2 , then when he cut the leftover 1/2 into 3 pieces, 
each new piece would be 1/6 (since 3 pieces make 1/2, 6 would make a whole 
cookie, therefore each piece is 1/6). So each person would get 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 , 
now of course 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 = 1 + 8/12 = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3 . My question is how did 
he come up with 12ths? I think doing it different ways is a key idea! &quot;We also 
reworked the original problem dividing 5 cards between 3 and kept cutting each 
piece in two.&nbsp; He saw that it the problem became an infinite series&quot;. That's 
great!&nbsp; Instead of cutting into 2 equal pieces, suppose you cut into 10 equal 
pieces! Then what will he come up with? This gets more interesting as one goes 
on!! He has a name for 2/3 = 8/12 and = 1/2 + 0/4+1/8+0/16+1/32+ ...&nbsp; (did you 
put in the zero terms?) and equals 0.666666... and if you write the infinite 
series as a bimal 1/2 + 0/4+1/8+0/16+1/32+ ... = .101010... (an infinite 
repeating bimal), and you could write the infinite repeating decimal 0.6666... 
as an infinite series 6/10+6/100+6/1000+...&nbsp; he might even become a member of 
&quot;The Order of Bimal&quot; - those students (in IA) who multiplied 2 infinite series 
together! ;-)&nbsp; Maybe 3 people that I know of are in that &quot;Order&quot;. <br>
<br>
On the Harmonic series, that is very slowly diverging. I had some kids go for 
maybe 1000 terms added on the calculator and they were convinced it would go to 
10 or 14. Then one of the parents had the use of a large computer and did it out 
to 1 million terms, and it still kept increasing.<br>
<br>
&quot;He was able to complete page Q93&nbsp; (the graphs)&quot;. Great!<br>
<br>
The function stuff was fine! How about&nbsp; graphing x/2 - 2= y what's the slope and 
intercept (he probably can do that now!)? and how about throwing in a quadratic 
function at him, like #3 and #4 on p.88.<br>
<br>
He knows 4-5= -1 and 4^2 = 16. He could make the picture of the square numbers, 
see
<a href="/html/tara2.html" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
Tara's work</a>, and then you could start him 
on quadratic equations (use the sequence of problems in my book!). You know you 
can search my website on the main page. I just did that to find Tara's, my 
granddaughter�s, work!<br>
<br>
Got to go. Keep up the fine work, you two!!!<br>

Don to Valerie:<br>
&quot;I kept looking and thinking about the picture you made of the 5^2 +2x5 + 1 (and 
got 6^2). Then I played around with that. I realized how to &quot;complete the 
square&quot; with this model.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had 5^2 + 2 strips on each side or 4 fives, 
and there would be 4 invisibles in the corner. So 5^2 + 4x5 + 4 = 49=7^2. and 
7^2 + 6 strips (3 strips on the two sides) + 9 = 10^2 = 7^2+6x7+9 = 49 + 42 + 9 
= 100. Now the question is how does one get the adding number from the # of 
strips? from 6 to 9, from 2 to 1...And 46^2 = 40^2 + 12x40 + 36 = 2116 !! If you 
had x^2 + ax + _____ to get a perfect square? See the attached file.&nbsp;

Valerie to Don: �</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#339966">Don, 
Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; Justin and I worked on finding the partial sums of the 
infinite series (1/x) + (1/x<span class="grame">)</span><sup>2</sup> + (1/x)<sup>3</sup> 
+ ... for �, 1/3, 
and �.&nbsp; He was able to see where each sum was converging, but other than the � 
series the partial sums didn�t mean much to him.&nbsp; We then played around with 
Excel entering values for A and B and set up columns to find the sum of (A/B) + 
(A/B<span class="grame">)</span><sup>2</sup> + (A/B)<sup>3</sup> �&nbsp; We were able to find what 
various combinations of A and B converged/diverged to but had to peek in the 
book to see the pattern!&nbsp; Justin particularly liked the cases where A &gt; B!&nbsp; We 
got sidetracked trying to figure out how many rows the Excel spreadsheet 
contained.&nbsp; Justin found that it ended at 65536, and we talked about the 
reasoning behind that value.&nbsp; We divided it out until we started to see our 
binary friends and determined that 65536 was the largest value for a 16 bit 
system (1 � 65536 instead of 0 to 65535).&nbsp; We then worked on filling all 65536 
rows with various types of math problems!</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#339966">Later 
Justin created a couple of pages of function machines for me to guess 
(justin01150001-3) which I graphed for him (justin01150004).&nbsp; They gave him 
great practice working with fractions!&nbsp; I then gave him a line with a slope of 
2/3 to figure out, but he had a hard time figuring out what 2/3 of any number is 
(tried to show him with 3 and 6 but he didn�t know what to do with any of the in 
between values were as he doesn�t understand multiplying fractions). I did show 
him how the line went up 2 for every 3 it went over.</span><span style="color:#339966">

Every time</span> I turn around he has a couple more pages of functions for me 
to guess.&nbsp; He�s been trying to make them �extra-advanced level�!&nbsp; I�m sending a 
graph of 10 functions machines he made for me to solve in 10 minutes 
(justin01160002) as well as some lines I drew for him to guess the functions of 
(justin01160001).&nbsp; He was able to find the functions of each line; although the 
negative slopes gave him trouble for a little bit.&quot;</span></b></p>

How about asking Justin, &quot;All the graphs and functions you have made so far are 
linear, come out straight lines. What would you have to do to get a curve, a 
non-linear function?&quot; See if he can find a way to do this without Mom.<br>

I would be glad to work with him in the future and it would be great if you

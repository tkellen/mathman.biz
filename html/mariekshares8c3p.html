	<p>Marie had been cookie-sharing for weeks, getting infinite series for 
	some. The evening before this video her Dad had shown her how to divide 8 by 3
  
  
  

	and talked about other things as shown below. This was the page Don and 
	Marie were referring to during the video.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mathheadinc.com">Lori Johnson Morse</a> had come from KC, 
MO, with her 
husband Joe, to visit Don, observe and talk about math stuff&nbsp; She took on 
the job of&nbsp; <font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>videotaping</b></font> 
Don and Marie as Marie shared 8 cookies between 3 people. The exciting thing 
that happened was that, a first for Don, Marie, in sharing the cookies, divided 
each leftover cookie into <font color="#FF0000"><b>10 equal pieces! </b></font>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>&nbsp;</b></font> No one in Don's 58 years of teaching 
math had ever done this. Why is this so exciting? Because one gets the infinite 
series 2 + 6/10 + 6/100 + 6/1000 +...as well as the infinite repeating decimal = 2.666..., as well as the mixed number 
=2 2/3</p>
<p>Now the video is 11+ minutes. And there was a lot going on: Don wanted to 
capture a<b><font size="4" face="Arial"> 7 year old </font></b>doing all of this 
(cutting leftover cookies&nbsp; into 10 pieces(!)). </p>
<p><b><font size="5" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">So the important things to 
remember are:</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<p>1. The problem was to share 8 cookies between 3 people.</p>
			<p>2. Everyone got 2 cookies, and there were 2 cookies left over.</p>
			<p>3. Marie cut the 2 leftover cookies into 10 pieces (tenths).</p>
			<p>4. There were 20 tenths to share</p>
			<p>5. Each person got 6 tenths of a cookie</p>
			<p>6. And there were 2 tenths left over</p>
			<p>7. Then Marie cut each tenth into 10 pieces, to get 20 
			hundredths. </p>
			<p><b><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#FF0000">This is where the 
			video begins! Where Don tries to start again for the camera, and 
			then again when Sydney's Mom comes in to pick her up, and again when 
			Marie's Dad comes in to pick Marie and her sister Ann up. And 
			Marie's Dad wanted to know what happens when the girls stop coming 
			to see Don. (They later said they would be returning in November). 
			And Lori did a fantastic job of videotaping for our amateur movie.</font></b></p>
			<p>Then this repeats to get 6 thousandths... and to get the infinite 
			series 2 + 6/10 + 6/100 + ...=&nbsp; 2.666... an infinite repeating 
			decimal&nbsp; = 2 2/3, a mixed number and the fraction 8/3!!</p>

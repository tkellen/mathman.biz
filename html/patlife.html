<p align="left"><font size="3">1. Electricity - relationship between resistance
(ohms) of wires, current (flow of electrons-ampere), and voltage (volts)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Alternating Current (AC) made up of sine waves-
amplitude, frequency and period or time duration of one cycle; used for TV, desk-top
computer, scanner, printer, lights, refrigerator, air conditioner (<a href="trig.html">trig
functions</a>).&nbsp; Radio waves are sine waves- frequency (kiloHertz), UHF (MegaHertz);
Amplitude Modulation /AM radio-lower frequencies, wave's height (amplitude) is changed at audio
rate), FM-Frequency Modulation- higher frequency, changed at audio rates).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Direct Current (DC) for telephone lights, caller
ID, clock, flashlight, cell phone, portable phone, calculator, car; binary
circuits and boolean algebra used in switching circuits; resonance; electromagnetic frequencies- radio,
infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays, cosmic rays; audio
frequencies (sound); power (watts), energy (watt-hours) the work energy does for
you- what you pay the electric company for using your lights, AC; fiber optic
cable.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">2. Music- Stringed instruments- Guitar, piano,
cello, violin (length of string vs frequency of note); organ (length of tubes
vs. frequency)..Amplifier, radio</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">3. Time- calendar, clock, seconds, minutes,
years; Stonehenge; pulse rate, blood pressure; menstrual period, gestation
period, eons, generations, ages.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">4. floor patterns, quilts</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">5. DNA molecule</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">6. Hardness-Mohs' scale- diamond 15, to talc 1</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">7. Units of measurement</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">8. Pattern in metric prefixes</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">9. Sound -decibels (loudness), frequencies
(pitch); ear; radio,
sound system, audio, speakers, hearing test</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">10. The Internet-bandwidth, download time (baud
rate),</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">11. ph -measure of acidity/base of soil,
solutions, growing food, taste of food</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">12. Radiation-radio, MRI, X-rays, radioactive
nuclear radiation; 1/2 life; radioactive dating, radio beam, radio controlled
flight</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">13. Bicycles- gear ratio-&gt;no. of revolutions
(gear) vs. the distance traveled.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">14. Maps, globe</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">16. Light, optics, lenses</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">17. Rates- gas: miles/gallon; interest rate: 5% =
$5/$100; speed in miles/hr (km/hr); baud rate (signal processing rate) : _
KiloBytes/second; exchange rate: example $/yen; postal rates: cents/ounce
(changes with the weight), overseas rate, airmail rates; travel per diem rate
$/day paid for housing; investment rates on CDs, money markets, auto loan,
credit card rates, savings, and other FDIC-insured products; state: income tax
rate, sales tax rate, mortgage rates; phone rates: example 4.9ï¿½/minute; advertising
rates $/inch; airline rates; hourly wage rate $/hr.; crime rate, incarceration
rates; graduation rate; life insurance rate; subscription rate; <span class="rainforests">rates
of Rainforest Loss; hotel room rates; Nuclear Decay Rates; pregnancy success
rates; <font face="Arial" size="3">Service Rates (internet access); dropout
rates, graduation rates; education benefit payment rates</font></span></font>; <font face="Arial">water
rates; unemployment rates;</font>
brokerage <font size="3">rates; car rental rates; conference <font face="Arial">registration
rates; Unemployment Insurance rate; diabetes rates; ski rates; daily Loan
Deficiency Payment rates (farms); success rates; In chenistry: Reaction Rates,
Accidental Release Flow Rates From Pressurized Gas Systems, dripping rates;
Physics: velocity is the rate of change of distance with respect to time;
acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time; Math: a
rate is a ratio, comparing by division; the slope of a curve is a ratio, % is a
rate or ratio (per 100, divided by 100); consumption rates (of fuel, water..).</font></font></p>

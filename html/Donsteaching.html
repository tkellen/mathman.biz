    approach studies one simple concept at a time- boring- isolated, irrelevant.

    Instead- have a more interesting, complicated problem, that uses these

    concepts in finding the answer. This leads the student through math

    concepts, seeing them in their natural context and usefulness. Also, when

    the problem is finally solved, the "Look what I can do!" feeling

    spurs further exploration of math."</font></span></b></p>

    <b><font size="4" face="Arial">3 April, 2012 , <font color="#008000">a 
	Facebook message from Maggie Q.&nbsp; Hello Don! I hope you remember me. I just 
	wanted to send a message to let you know what a positive influence you had 
	on my life growing up. I just watched a documentary about the Mandelbrot 
	equation, and it reminded me that you always had a picture of it in your 
	basement and would refer to it occasionally. I never really understood it, 
	but I think I get the basic gist of it now. </font></font>
	<p><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#008000">While I didn't grow up to be 
	a mathematician or anything like that, you helped me feel more comfortable 
	around tougher conceptual ideas. You always had me doing such cool stuff. It 
	made math seems more accessible to me, and increased my self efficacy and 
	self esteem. The basic understanding has helped me connect with the world 
	and have a better understanding of current events. I ended up going into 
	business, but work on the business and user end of software development, so 
	am around technical people every day. I actually got called back twice for a 
	job at Wolfram Alpha, but eventually decided to move to Vancouver, BC to be 
	with my family. </font></p>
	<p><font size="4" face="Arial" color="#008000">I have never told you before 
	how much I appreciated your help growing up. It meant a lot to me to have 
	someone on my team and rooting for me. I had a rougher time as a teenager, 
	perhaps because Champaign was so quiet and small, but things have been going 
	really well since then. I try to stay current on math and science events, 
	and am fascinated by all of it, even if I don't fully understand it. I don't 
	know if I can truly express the positive impact that your influence had on 
	me, but I tried! Please take care and I wish for all of the best for you and 
	Marilyn! Regards, Maggie Q</font><font size="4"> </font></b></p>

  I am no dunce at mathematics, yet from the time I was six years old, I have

studied with a math tutor named Don Cohen. &nbsp;Math, while an extremely

important skill, is not the most crucial lesson I have learned from him through

the years. &nbsp;Don Cohen, a renowned math teacher and a winner of many

teaching awards</font><font color="#000000" size="3">[2]</font><font color="#008000" size="3">, is known for his unusual approaches to teaching. &nbsp;My math

instruction has been no exception. &nbsp;I have not memorized a single formula,

and instead, I have learned to approach math problems from different

perspectives. &nbsp;Simple lessons that I have learned, such as any problem can

be broken down into a simpler form of the same problem, have uses outside the

field of mathematics. &nbsp;I have learned the analytical thinking that is

essential to mathematics. &nbsp;At the same time, this discipline influences my

other thought processes to this day.

<br>Greetings from&nbsp;<st1:state>

Ohio!&nbsp;<br>I�ve always meant to keep in touch but time seems to slip by.

Now that I�m ready to graduate I thought I�d drop you a line to tell you how

much I appreciate the few years I got to work with you in The Math Program.&nbsp;You

instilled a love for math in me that was able to get me through many hours of

boring high school math.<o:p>

</o:p>

<br>I will be graduating June

5th&nbsp;as valedictorian of my class.&nbsp;Through the Academy Program offered

by the State of&nbsp;<st1:state>

Ohio, I was able to attend the local branch of&nbsp;<st1:state>Ohio&nbsp;</st1:state>State my Jr. and Sr.&nbsp;years and will graduate with 65 hours of college

credit.<br>I am a National Merit

Finalist and am attending Ohio State Honors Program on a full academic

scholarship.

<br>Even though my math teachers

tried to put me down for my odd ways of performing math, I managed a 790 on my

Math SAT and am planning on majoring in both Math and Psychology.<br>I�ve always regretted

having to move away from your program but what you gave me really helped mold

what I am today.<o:p>

Mr. Cohen,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

&nbsp;<br>

I am a past student of yours and I was just thinking about you the other day and

thought I would see how you were doing. You taught me about 11 years ago until

my family moved to Chicago. I have since graduated college with the idea that I

would be premed, but found myself in a Master's of Science program in

epidemiology and biostatistics. I haven't had a math course since freshman year

of college but I am loving statistics and I am currently applying to PhD

programs in biostatistics as well as medical school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

<br>

I wouldn't have the math abilities that I do today if it weren't for some of the

guidance you gave me early on. In fact, when I doubt my math background I always

remember your encouragement.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>

<br>

Before I moved you gave me a watercolor of a tornado. It was the first picture I

hung up in my new room and I think of you every time I see it. I hope you and

your family are doing well and you are still helping students learn to enjoy and

appreciate mathematics.<br>

<br>

Thank you for everything you did for me in the past.<br>

<b>9 March 2008 Homeschooling mom emails Don: &quot;Dear Don, ..I teach an enrichment 
math class to 6th and 7th grade students. I also tutor between 8-10 children a 
week separately from my work in the classroom. I am excited by your philosophy 
and methods. I am not a certified teacher. I just happen to be a homeschooling 
mom who was passionate about preventing innumeracy in my children. I read 
Marilyn Burns and used Miquon Math. From there I discovered Harold Jacobs' books 
and The Number Devil. I hate timed tests for times tables. I always want my 
students to find the pattern and connections between math topics. I especially 
want them to get excited and see the beauty of mathematics.<br>
<br>
Would it be possible for me to come to learn from you how to better serve/teach 
my students. I took Calculus in high school and college, but I have had no use 
for it in my life. I would like to learn Calculus the way I try to teach my 
classes so that I can make the connection for my students&quot;.

Don Cohen is my math hero. His site is not flashy, but his methods are nothing 
short of wondrous. I had the privilege of spending two days with him and his 
lovely wife, Marilyn. Watching him in action with his students is what I imagine 
it is like for people who claim to gain a spiritual benefit by being in the 
presence of their guru. Don's presence and manner with his students inspired me 
as much as his work, Calculus By and For Young People. <br>

    understanding of patterns that lead to infinite series. during the Live

    event, we got to see the true joy that Don still gets from seeing his

    students succeed. Don has put together, with the help of one of his former

    students a wonderful �map� of calculus. The map has all sorts of

    examples of the work his students have done through the years. Some of the

    more notable work has been done by 2nd � 4th graders wherein they

    discovered infinite series while working on problems such as � how can you

    divide 6 cookies among 7 people?� While he does not introduce any formal

    calculus terminology into his teaching of young children he is able to bring

    out the important concepts that they will need later in their schooling, all

    while helping to take away the �fear� of math.</font></b></p>

      he is now teaching their children. And in one case, he mentioned that he

      is teaching a third generation of children from the same family.

      Regardless of the subtlety with which Don guides his young learners, I

      ten and then counting starting with your left pinky. Well, Ashley thought

      that was cool, and the next day she said she wanted to explain a math

      problem to him. I chuckled to myself as I drove, because I knew what she

      was going to explain. He kind of brushed her off, and he&nbsp;explained

    <span lang="">

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>While watching my 26 year old

    son with Don aka "the mathman" this morning at breakfast, it was

    de ja vu only with a twist. This morning, Jonathan was going over material

    and making drawings to illustrate to Don some things that he may not have

    known instead of Don doing the illustrations and making explanations for him

    as Don had done many times and many years ago.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>You see, Don was highly

    recommended to me by a very good friend who sent her daughter to him when

    she struggled with math before becoming a teacher years later.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>I called him and explained that

    my son was 12 and was being made to feel &nbsp;he was stupid in school when

    it came to math, even though he excelled to a level far beyond most in his

    class and many other classes above him in every other subject. I knew

    something was terribly wrong and I had to do everything in my power to

    prevent his failure knowing how intelligent he was. I just couldn't seem to

    help him because he needed to learn math in a different way from the one and

    only way it was being taught in the schools. I was also taught that one

    particular way which was why I never excelled in math and really wasn't ever

    excited about it even to this day.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>To make a long story short, a

    meeting and first 2 hour lesson was set up with "the mathman" and

    when I dropped my son off, all I could do was pray that this might be the

    help he needed. Lo and behold, when I picked Jonathan up from his lesson and

    he got into the car, he excitedly began to tell me about the things he did

    and learned in that two hours and he never stopped talking about math from

    that day and couldn't wait to get out of school for the day to get to Mr.

    Cohen's lessons so he could actually learn something.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>You see, Don has a special way

    of relating to all of his students that gives them self esteem and makes

    them realize they can not only learn to do math, but they can also enjoy

    math and do more than they ever dreamed they could, like calculus. He knows

    not every child learns in only one way and Don lets the students know that

    that does not make them wrong OR STUPID!</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>I heard someone ask Don to

    explain what his method of teaching was. "How do you do what you do

    with so much success?"</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Until I actually observed some

    of the sessions and could see the excitement of his students including my

    own child, I couldn't have pinpointed any obvious teaching method per se. I

    can only say that Don opens the minds of his students and expands their

    horizons in such a way that is simply unbelievable. My explanation is that

    it is his personality.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Don can pull things out of the

    students by getting them to reach far back into their minds and find answers

    that they never would have considered looking for had they not been sitting

    beside him. If they come up with a different answer to something, he doesn't

    tell them they are wrong, he says let's look at this and see how you arrived

    at that answer.</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>What a concept!&nbsp;</b></font></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Soon, the students are looking

    at mathematics in an entirely different light and looking to their future in

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Barbara: Mr. Cohen, I felt like I was channelling

    yesterday when Maggie and I got involved in figuring out how many pieces

    there were in the huge lego pyramid she had built. &nbsp;My favorite part

    was when she realized that there was a quicker but less interesting way to

    do the calculations, and she said, "Let's do it the longer way! &nbsp;It's

    more fun!"<o:p>

    </o:p>

    </b></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>I posted a photo of the pyramid and tagged you in

    it. I'm not sure if it's readable, but that white piece of paper says

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Donald Cohen:&nbsp;your pyramid is a marvel, Maggie!

    It looks like an Egyptian pyramid. I like the idea of doing something the

    longer way too, but more fun in the process. Is the pyramid made by the

    squares of even numbers? Like 2^2=4, 4^2=16, 6^2=36?&nbsp;<o:p>

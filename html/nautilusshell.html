<p> For the <b>Nautilus shell</b>, <center>
<img
src="../images/nau&eq.gif" width="511" height="311"> </center>the ratio of 
radius vectors 
every 360 degrees is a constant, about 3.2. My students average their 
mesurements and get pretty close to that (within 10%). The angle 
comes out another constant, about 79.5 degrees; this spiral is called an 
equiangular spiral because of this. A number of young people have worked 
on these problems of the Nautilus shell. Vickie, a 9th grader at the 
time, used the half-shell, and studied the volume increase from section 
to section. I have a full and half shell in my 
"Math Room". The shell is beautiful and mathematical, that's why it is my 
logo. The shell on my main web site page is a copy of a watercolor 
painting I did of the shell. The rubbing is on the left. The polar equation of the shell spiral is r = 
<b>e</b><sup><font 
size= -1>t * cot (79.5*Pi/180)</font></sup> The polar plot of this 
equation in <I>Mathematica</I> looks like that at right above. You can see when t 
=0, r =1. A 360 degree 
turn (t=2*Pi) gives an r of about 3.2, and the Nautilus grows at this constant 
ratio throughout (as mentioned above). (See also Frank 
Land's book "The Language of Mathematics", Doubleday, 1963).</p>

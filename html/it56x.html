the limits of the infinite sequences we get.<br>
Starting number 1. Putting 1->x, we get 5-(6/1)=<sup>-</sup>1. Putting this output 
number <sup>-</sup>1 in for x now, we get 5-(6/-1) = 11. Putting 11 -> x we get 
5-(6/11)= 4.45.. <br>So we get this infinite sequence: <br>1, -1, 11, 
4.45.., 3.653..., 3.3575..., 3.2129..., ...which goes to 3 as the 
limit.<br>Starting no. -100, 5.06, 3.81422..., 3.4269..., 
3.2491...,3.1533..., ...which goes to 3 as the limit.<br>

Notice that starting with 2 we get a constant sequence 2, 2, 2, ... On 
the graph 2 goes to 2.<br>All other starting numbers lead to an infinite 
sequence which goes to 3 as the limit.., <b>except an infinite number of 
starting numbers like zero, and 6/5 that at some point make the denominator 
go to 
0 and make the fraction 'blow up' and thus has no answer. These numbers 
put a hole in the graph. </b>Can you find a rule for these numbers that 
make the denominato 0? What is the limit of the sequence of these numbers?

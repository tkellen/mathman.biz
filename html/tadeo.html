Don met, spoke with and saw on their webcam, Tadeo (age 9), his brother Pablo, 
and their Mom and Dad, who all live in Argentina. Don 
will be working with Tadeo once a week in his worksheet book via Yahoo Instant 
Messenger. He and his Dad (who translated the question section of chapter 1 into 
Spanish for his son), have been working in chapter 1, the infinite series; he 
figured out that if you start with 1/n, the limit will be 1/(n-1)-&nbsp; 
</font><font color="#FF00FF">he did a fine job with this, see below</font><font color="#008000">!

<b><font color="#008000">On
</font><font size="4">17 November 2003</font><font color="#008000"> Don started 
working 
with Tadeo on graphing linear equations. He came up with a couple of interesting 
patterns!</font></b></font> <b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Here is Don's 
version of their session.</font></b><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>
<font color="#008000">Don started Tadeo with the graphing of the equation 2x+3 = 
y (below). He was to try a small number to put in for x, he chose 4, then what 
would he put in for y to make the equation </font>
<font size="4" color="#FF00FF">true = verdad</font><font color="#008000">?&nbsp; 
Well 2*4 (2 </font><font color="#FF00FF" size="4">times =</font><font color="#008000">
</font><font color="#FF00FF" size="4">por</font><font color="#008000"> 4) + 3 
=11, so the if you put 4 in for x and 11 in for y the sentence would be true. 
(Don is learning some Spanish, as well as Tadeo is learning some English- it's a 
good thing Dad is helping with the translation!) If you put 4 in for x and 100 
for y, it would not be true. Tadeo plotted the point at (4,11); then he got more 
points and plotted those. The graphs below were made by Don, viewable by Tadeo. 
Dad will send Tadeo's graphs. They looked at the pattern in the graph, over 1 up 
2 and the y-numbers go up 2, when the x-number goes up 1. And there is a
<font size="4">2</font> in the equation! </font></b></font>

<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/tadeo/tadeo2gr.JPG" width="301" height="327"><p align="left">
<b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Then Don gave Tadeo the equation </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5x + 3 = y</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000">&nbsp; 
to graph. Tadeo noticed that the pattern in the graph was to go right 1 up
</font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
this time, and the y-numbers go up </font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
in the table when the x-number goes up 1. And there is a </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">5</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
in the equation! Tadeo said:&quot;When you go from the green line to the </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">red</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
line, the y-numbers go up 0, then 3, then 6, and so on&quot;. (0,3) is on both 
graphs, so the y-number 3 goes up 0. From (1,5) to </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">(1,8)</font>,
<font face="Arial" color="#008000">the y-number goes up 3; from (2,7) to </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">(2,13)</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
the y-number goes up 6, and so on. It took Don a while to understand what Tadeo 
was saying, because Don was focusing on the 2 numbers in the equation and not 
the change from one line the the other line. The other pattern Tadeo saw was:&quot; 
Whatever the multiplying number is, when you put 0 in for x, you get the adding 
number!&quot; </font><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">That was fine Tadeo!</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Then Don asked Tadeo to 
write the equation for the <font size="1">x </font>graph below. After some 
discussion, he came up with the equation</font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"> 
3x + 4 = y </font><font face="Arial" color="#008000">. They checked this 
equation by putting the pair of numbers (2,10) in for x and y and it made the 
equation true.</font></b></p>

the graphs #1, 2 and 3 for next week.</font></b></p>

<font color="#008000">On

<font face="Arial" color="#008000">Tadeo Showed Don the equations he had come up 
with for the 3 graphs above, eq. 1 was .5x+3=y, eq.2 was <sup><font size="4">-</font></sup>1x+1=y 
and eq. 3 was 0x+2=y. He did have a little trouble with #3, but got it.&nbsp; He 
also made Don a graph to find the equation, which turned out to be&nbsp; <sup>
<font size="4">- </font></sup>2x + 5=y. </font></b></p>

<p align="left">
<b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">At this point Don started Tadeo on solving 
equations (ch.8) -find the number(s) that make the sentence true. Tadeo got the 
first 2 correct, quickly</font></b></p>

<b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Since he was quick, knew 5<sup>2</sup> = 
25 and 4 - 5 = <sup><font size="4">-</font></sup>1, Don decided to have Tadeo 
work on solving quadratic equations. He solved five of these (see below) and saw the secrets 
to getting the 2 numbers that worked, like for </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
the answers are {2,3}. Don left him with 2 quadratic equations to solve for next 
time: </font><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">x<sup>2</sup> - 25x + 24 = 0&nbsp;

After multiplying 2 1/2 X 2 1/2&nbsp; three ways (1... 2.5x2.5, 2. using graph 
paper and counting squares, and 3. 5/2 x 5/2 = 25/4 = 6 1/4), Tadeo found the 
two answers for </font></b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF"><b>x<sup>2</sup> - 
6 1/2 x + 9 = 0 </b></font><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">to be {4 1/2,

<font face="Arial" color="#008000">{15,5}, and </font>

</font><font size="4" face="Arial">8 December 2003</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000">, Tadeo 
asked if we could work on multiplying and dividing decimals. We spent the whole 
time on that. He knew 1.25 which they write as 1,25 is 1 peso and 25 centavos 
and 100 centavos = 1 peso. And we went from there. He liked doing that after 
doing the infinite series and graphing with Don.</font></b></p>

<b><font color="#008000" face="Arial">On
</font><font size="4" face="Arial">15 December 2003</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000">, 
Don showed Tadeo the The Magic Number Game. See
<a href="/html/sherimagic.html">Sheri's work</a> 
and the cards Don sent to Tadeo. This involves counting in binary. After Tadeo 
wrote the number from 1-31 in binary, we looked at the table as Sheri had done. 
Then Don asked Tadeo if he had 6 cards what would change? What would the numbers 
go up to and how many number would be on each card? See
<a href="/html/kaitlin.html">Kaitlin's</a> cards.</font></b></p>

Then Don worked with Tadeo on cookie-sharing (ch.2). Don asked if he would share 
5 cookies between 3 people, how many would each person get? He figured that each

= 1.666...= 1 2/3 = 5/3 cookies! He figured out the first two, then HE asked if 
he could get a decimal; that's how they got the next 2. Then Don asked about the 
easiest way, and he got the last 2. </b></font><b><font color="#FF00FF">That was 
a most exciting day!</font><font color="#008000">; both his Dad who translated 
for him and he thought so also. Tadeo was going so fast at the beginning, Don

the children. They are looking forward to January when we will continue.</font></b></span></p>

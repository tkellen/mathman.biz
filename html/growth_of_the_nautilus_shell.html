<p>
<b><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> Don showed Deryn the whole Nautilus 
shell he has in his math room, from which came a watercolor painting, and the picture on each of his books and his logo. He had Deryn get her 
protractor and ruler and look at the 1/2 Nautilus shell on p. 103<sup> 
</sup> </font>
in Don's worksheet book- made from a 
rubbing of his 1/2 shell. They were going to study how the shell grows:

draw a radius vector, a </font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">line</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
from the center O to the edge of the shell at point A (</font><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">in

and OB in millimeters, then found the ratio of OA/OB. Deryn got 50/14= 3.5 and 
Don got 50/14= 3.333... Don asked Deryn to do </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">two</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
other examples like this on the shell and average these three ratios. </font>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Then Don showed Deryn how 
to measure an angle with a protractor--a little difficult looking at a webcam 
picture. He showed Deryn how to draw a tangent line (touching the curve at only 
one point, A) . Don extended the line through O to better measure the angle. 
They each measured the </font><font face="Arial" color="#800000">smaller</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
angle at point A, shown above. Don measured&nbsp; 80</font></b><font face="Arial" color="#008000"><font size="4">�

other points and measure the </font><font face="Arial" color="#800000">smaller</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000">

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#FF00FF">This was a 
difficult task; we'll see what Deryn came up with the next week.</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">They averaged the ratios of OA/OB to 
see how the shell grew in 360</font></b><font face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>�</b></font><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000"> 
On Deryn's diagram below, she got 3.5 and 3.7, and Don got 3.3, 3.5 and 3.0 at
other places on the shell. 
After a slight error adding these, she got 17.03/5&nbsp; = 3.4 for the average. 
In <i>The Language of Mathematics</i> by Land, he came up with 3.2 (an error of 
about 6%). This is a constant a growth, no matter where one does the 
measurements!</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Deryn measured the smaller

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#008000">Because Deryn wasn't sure 
how to divide 37 by 10 quickly, they worked

Size and Life</u>, which is in The Scientific American Library, that the

<font face="Arial" color="#FF0000" size="4">Rock Island, IL</font><font face="Arial" color="#008000" size="4">,
after her 2 days observing, working with some students, and studying with Don:
&quot;Dear Don and Marilyn, Thank you both so much for your generous hospitality during my visit. I am so excited to get to work on the workbook and also to show my children what I have learned. I believe that children need to see their parents learning,
too..&quot;. </font>

<font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Elizabeth, it was wonderful that you
could come to Champaign, leave your family behind, meet some of my parents and
work with some of my students. You did very well, had some fine ideas that we
share, and even figured out the area and perimeter of the snowflake curve, using
infinite series- not an simple task! </font>

one but the computer to chat to when you have one of those &quot;aha&quot; moments when 
everything clicks.&nbsp; I also think that he has mastered how to get through the

Right now he plows through math on his own, but I don't see the same spark from

you for your help in getting Jonathan started on a successful path in
mathematics. As you can see [8 pages of his awards and records in HS] it has led
to an exciting future career. He thinks that he might be interested in proving
or disproving &quot;string theory&quot;, but is open minded and wants to learn
about all branches of physics when he starts out at Cornell. Your enthusiasm for
math has set such a shining example for Jonathan and our whole family as you
have pursued a life long love of mathematics and learning. We greatly appreciate
your interest in Jonathan and your help over the years&quot;.</font></p>

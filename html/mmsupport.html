<b><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#007f00">And don't worry about your
  child making mistakes</font></b><font FACE="Arial" COLOR="#007f00">. The
  following is a quote in Don's little book, from MATHEMATICS THE LOSS OF
  CERTAINTY by Morris Kline:<br>
  <br>
  &quot;In his first paper on the Calculus (1669), Newton proudly introduced the
  use of infinite series to expedite the processes of the calculus...<br>
  <br>
  As Newton, Leibnitz, the several Bernoullis, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and
  other 18th-century men struggled with the strange problem of infinite series
  and employed them in analysis, they perpetuated all sorts of blunders, made
  false proofs, and drew incorrect conclusions; they even gave arguments that
  now with hindsight we are obliged to call ludicrous.&quot;<br>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><br>
  If one starts at a young age, working on these ideas, allowing for all the
  mistakes, one will really understand things better later on. Don has seen
  children do just that and it has been very encouraging for him. You don't have
  to feel you need to know everything before the children see the problem. Don
  feels if he doesn't expect a child to solve a problem a certain way, they will
  pleasantly surprise him, and he will learn something new!</p>

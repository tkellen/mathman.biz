&quot;..Although I must admit that the word 'worksheets' has a lot of negative
associations and connotations in our minds(I've spent a lot of time railing
against the excessive use of mindless worksheets in elementary schools), your
WORKSHEETS are a special case, in a class by themselves. The intelectual
excitement is almost palpable, leaping right off the page at the reader. ..They
are engaging and they make your projects accessible to a broader group of
stuents and parents.
<p>..Your opening page of advice, 'On thinking about and doing mathematics' is
great. It debunks so many preconceived notions that children (and adults) have
picked up in school about math. In fact, much of the advice is applicable
outside math as well. Your enthusiastic outlook on math, learning, and life is
one we can all share. (In fact, if you want another idea for a poster: Just
blowing up those words of wisdom on page iii would make a great one that belongs
over the desk of every child in America!)
<p>What I really like about your worksheets is that they invite the reader to
really engage in serious work and hard thinking in such a delightful and low-key
way. Moreover, it seems like children like Beth (age 8) can use them
independently without the need for handholding and cheerleading. I also like the
way you encourage children to feel free to choose their own order of working
throughout the book (after the first two chapters).
<p>In summary: when Beth received your little book, she didn't want to go to bed
that night. When your worksheets arrived, she didn't want to go to school
either! It's hard for plain old school to compete with the intellectual
excitement of your ideas. Your approach to helping children build their own
understanding of mathematics will profoundly affect their lives. Cheers.&quot;--<b>Meg

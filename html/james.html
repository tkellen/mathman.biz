<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/james1.jpg" width="689" height="590"></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">June 24, 2001</font></b> James was working on
pp. 11-13 in Don's worksheet book and made a table of the place values in
different bases (there should be a 1 in the ones column for every base). he
scanned these sheets and sent them to Don as attached files. One he sent as an
AIM file.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/jamesbase.jpg" width="528" height="743"></p>
<p align="left">James made a code for writing numbers in base 5.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/jamesbase5.jpg" width="422" height="606"></p>
<p align="left">Then he sent Don the following problem to change the numeral in
his base 5 code&nbsp; to our base ten:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/jamesbase5prob.jpg" width="601" height="138"></p>
<p align="left">Don wrote this as 2100 (base 5) and equals 2x125 + 1x25 + 0x5 +
0x1 = 250 + 25 = 275 (base 10). And James over the voice using AIM told Don this
was correct. Then Don gave James the following numeral in binary 11011 (base 2)
to change to decimal. James came back quickly with 11011 (base 2) = 27 (base
10). <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Fine job James!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000">At this point in James' and Don's
communications: James wants to do his work in Don's book first thing in the
morning and Carolyn is very pleased with what James is doing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000">From James on </font><font size="4">July
11, 2001</font><font color="#008000"> after 2 weeks of bronchitis; his graph of
the partial sums for 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 ...</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="4">July 19, 2001</font><font color="#008000">: </font></b><font color="#008000">Carolyn
and Don had arranged this session by email. </font><font color="#FF00FF">On AIM</font><font color="#008000">,
James played the &quot;Guess My Number&quot; game with Don. James and his Mum
had Don get <a href="/html/sherimagic.html">Sheri's
page</a> on his screen. Then James asked Don which cards contained his number
and he successfully found Don's number. Then Don found James' number. James
graphed x+y=9 (because he is 9), scanned it and sent this to Don in AIM:</font><br>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/jamesxy9b.JPG" width="410" height="417"></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000">On AIM, Don had James find the coordinates
for (10, <font size="4"><sup>-</sup></font>1) which he did and Don had him
add&nbsp; 10&nbsp; + <font size="4"><sup>-</sup></font>1 = 9 which he did. Don
spent time talking with Carolyn about how the negatives should be written with
the </font><font color="#FF0000">sign raised</font><font color="#008000"> . Most
textbooks after more than 30 years that we write it correctly, still write the
negative number with a </font><font color="#FF00FF">minus</font><font color="#008000">
sign, then they need parentheses around it like 10 + (-1) = 9, and it gets very
complicated. Don pointed this out to Carolyn on page 108 in his worksheet book,
which they have near the computer. Carolyn communicated this to James. Then Don
asked him to get the coordinates of a point between points on the graph. He
found 2 1/2 and 6 1/2 and added them to get 9. Sometimes Don spoke to James and
sometimes to his Mum, Carolyn.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000">Then James scanned and sent on AIM the
table he extended for the &quot;Guess My Rule&quot; game on p. 87 in Ch. 6 of
Don's worksheet book, which he figured out to be 2x+3=y. Don said he had a new
rule for James to figure out.&nbsp; (It was 3x-2=y) Don asked for a number to
put into his machine. James said 100, Don gave him back 298. At that point James
said Don's rule was 2x+98=y&nbsp; because 2x100+98=298. Of course that works for
his rule. Then Don asked James to try another number. He gave 10 and Don gave
him back 28. There was dead silence for about a minute and James wrote 3x-2=y !
Don wrote <font size="6">YES!</font><font size="3"> and James came back with
YYYYYAAAAAAYYYYY!!! Everyone jumped with joy and clapped!&nbsp; Don left 4
things for James to work on: 1/3 + 1/9 +... in Ch. 1, the cookie sharing in Ch.
2, graphing 2x+3=y on p. 92 in Ch. 6, and solving equations on p. 145 in Ch. 8.
Despite the sound breaking up some, it was a very exciting session! </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF00FF">Great
work James!</font><b>

I took the ones with Tessa and Terri, her Mom.<o:p>

</o:p>
 My only comment on your thing with Michael was I wouldn't go to 800+800 too
quickly. I stay with something they can do, 1+1, but change the size and
names...like 1000000+1000000 and 1 sin x + 1 sin x.. Capice? Comprende? Dig?
Next could be 1 square root of 7 + 1 square root of 7 (using the square root
symbol),&nbsp; -1 + -1 . At one point I think Tessa asked Michele what's 100,000
+ 1,000,000 and I winced, and Michele answered correctly, but I don't think
Tessa understood it. And I wouldn't do that! The kids always seem to make up
harder ones than I do. I started a 5-year old here Tuesday and did a similar
thing with her as I did with Tessa, and she did well also.<o:p>

should be fine next week, but it might be best if he starts<o:p>

confused when he said the<o:p>

</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2*x + 8=24&nbsp; then adding ten to get the next one<o:p>

<font size="4">August 2</font>,&nbsp; 2001</b>Hi Don,<br>
my Aim is busy upgrading.<o:p>

<p>james was doing page 88 Guess my rule today. he also found an old series he
did a few days ago and said it was &quot;double it add 3&quot; well how do you
say that in mathematical language? &quot;Two times, no - two ecks plus three
equals Y. wow I didn't know I could say that!&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>so then he wrote the equations for 2 and 4, for the others he knows what
is<o:p>
</o:p>happening - number one is adding 7 to the y before, and he knows what
number 3 looks like on a graph&nbsp; but he can't express them.<o:p>

AIM Carolyn told Don James had figured out the cards for The Magic Number game
for base 3. On the original 5 cards in binary, they went up to 31 (1 less than
32, a power of 2). James thought going up to 26 (1 less than&nbsp; 27, a power
of 3) would be too small, and 80 (1 less than 81, the next&nbsp; power of 3)
would be too large. He decided to go to 38. [One of Don's students on Aug. 13,
ended up at 56 for the same problem!]</font></p>

in for class at that time. Amanda talked with Carolyn and the other student

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi Don,<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can we stop for a fortnight?&nbsp; They have school
holidays next week. James did some stuff today. Sending it later. I would like
to get into more of a routine where he does a tiny bit everyday and we chat
online once a fortnight, or where he does a lot intensively for a few days once
a month. He's quite slow and he has a lot of other 'regular' maths to learn too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">David is keen to do some stuff - he has tried the stuff on
page 15 too but can't see how it goes to a half.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">late reply - OK? Have James start the quadratic equations.
Did he find the equation for graph #3? [no]. Did he check graph #2? [no] Start
on fibonacci numbers p129. [Maybe next month!]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How about starting with a 9 by 9 square on the graph paper
and work on 1/3 +&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/3 of 1/3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/3 of
1/3 of 1/3 ... (or 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27...) [ok he's done that. but I'm pretty sure
it's not all that clear to him what you want - at first he started colouring in
a quarters of a squares by accident</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- he didn't draw a nice obvious square outlined thickly in
black and I think he just sort of got 'lost'. And he had some pretty strange
answers for the questions initially. i'm not sure what he was thinking of. he
thought the partial sums progress to one, then he thought it goes to 243.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;however he saw a pattern in the colouring in and cut
out his shape and rearranged them to get oblongs stacking to the left and cubes
stacking on the right. So we worked through it and it is clearer now i hope.
using his graph he can see that if you draw a diagonal line that cuts from the
top L corner to the bottom R and cut out the little end of the oblongs that
stick over the line they fit next to the square of the next term and the whole
series will never cross the halfway line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>We haven't done a graph of x,y for it yet like
Geoffrey but he seemed to know how to plot the points without any help, so he's
started it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">cheers,Carolyn<br>
might chat to you online tonight</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="3">Carolyn sent Don James' graph
below via AIM. Carolyn and Don talked about the patterns in the parabola, the
curve, x*x=y.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="3">Don suggested to Carolyn<br>
1.) that James make his graphs so the origin (0,0) is not in the lower left
corner so he could plot negative numbers for x.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/jamesgrxx.jpg" width="492" height="596"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="3">2.) The slope of the parabola
changes, which makes it a curve, not a straight line when the slope is the same
everywhere. </font>Starting at (0,0), you go over 1 to the right and up 1 to get
to the next (integral) point. From (1,1) you go1 to the right and 3 up. Then
from (2,4) you go1 to the right and 3 up, then 5 up, then 7 up and so on. Why
because 1+3=4=2<sup>2 </sup>and 1+3+5=9=3<sup>2 </sup>,.., so the sum of the odd
numbers is a square number- and x*x = x<sup>2 </sup>, a square.<br>
3.) Don worked with James about multiplying negative numbers because Don wanted
him to graph x*x=y when x= <sup>-</sup>3. So what is <sup>-</sup>3 x <sup>-</sup>3?
Don used the pattern below from Sheri's page to help James get <sup>-</sup>3 x <sup>-</sup>3
= 9.
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/james.1.jpg" width="341" height="199"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">3.) It was James' idea to switch the x and y
and graph y*y=x. That was a great idea James!<br>
4.) Don worked with Carolyn on the differences in the y's, then the differences
in the differences, which are all 2. The differences in consecutive odd numbers
is 2. And the fact that the <font color="#FF0000"><b>2nd</b></font> difference
is constant, means the function is <font color="#FF0000"><b>2nd</b></font>
degree (x<sup><font color="#FF0000"><b>2</b></font></sup>).

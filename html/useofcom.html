<title>The Use of Calculators & Computers in Don's Materials</title>
<head><center><h3>The 
Use of Calculators and Computers in Don's Books and 
Tapes</h3></center></head><body>Don refuses to let his students use a 
calculator to do simple arithmetic. Much of what he does involves doing 
the arithmetic in your head and looking for patterns. The arithmetic, 
algebra, and patterns of 
infinite series and infinite sequences, however, make this a worthwhile 
use of 
calculators and computers.  Appendix 3 in Don's worksheet book describes 
how to write programs to do these jobs, and shows what programs are in 
each chapter. Below are some examples: <p>

<LI>With Don's help, a few students have written a program on a 
programmable calculator to change a fraction to its bimal. (Ch. 2)
<LI>A student will iterate, by hand,  a function like 5 + x/2, starting with 
say 1.  
This gives an infinite sequence, which on a calculator shows that it gets 
to 10. Then using <I>Mathematica</I>, the student can take the sequence to 
100 
decimal places, with 150 iterations and see that it still doesn't get to 10.
(Ch. 8)<LI> Most students are asked to solve quadratic equations 
first by guessing and eventually finding the secrets of the 
sum and product of the roots.  Then when they work on the 
quadratic equation x^2 - x - 1 = 0 by trying numbers with 
pencil and paper and then a calculator.  They get sequences 
of numbers too big and too small, leading to a 5 decimal 
approximation of the Golden Mean.  Then they can use <I>Derive</I>
to find a quick solution and see the exact (although 
irrational) answer, as well as see approximations with as 
many places as they like.  These are two of about ten ways 
Don gets kids to solve quadratic equations.  (Ch.8)<LI> 
Students, after doing it with a diagram on graph 
paper and finding patterns, will write a program  on a calculator or 
computer to get the sum of the infinite series 2/5 + (2/5)^2 + 
...(Ch.1)<LI>A 7th-grader while trying things on a calculator, took 
repeated square roots of a number. He found that no matter what number 
he started with he would always get to 1. (Ch.10)<LI>While Ian was 
playing with powers of powers on his calculator during Physics class, he 
came across a function which goes to e as x goes to infinity. (Ch.11) <LI> 
Don wrote a program on a 
programmable calculator that finds the area under a curve by plotting 
points under the curve, counting these points, then finding 
the ratio of the number plotted to the number filling a 1x1 square.
(Ch.13)<LI>Don helped Khaki use 
<I>Derive</I> to plot a graph, then zoom in on a point until 
the curve looks like a straight line. She found the slope of this line. 
Keeping track of this slope for a few points, she figured out a rule to 
find the slope at a given x-coordinate, arriving at the derivative! (Ch.14)

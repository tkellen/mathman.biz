days</b></p>

<p class="p2">(her mother lived in Champaign 30 years ago when she
worked with Don)</p>

<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p4"><b><big><big>Day 1:&nbsp; Wednesday 29 June 2011</big></big><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<big> <span style="font-family: Arial;">1. Don had
her graph x+y=7 (she would turn 7 in 2 weeks). Sarah had never graphed
like this before. Don doesn’t talk too much, but asked her for&nbsp;
two numbers that add to 7. He made the x- and y- axes, and put the
numbers on the lines along the axes. Then he showed her how to plot the
point (6,1). We start at (0,0), move along the x-axis to the right 6
units for x, then go up 1 for y. And off she went.</span></big></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" class="p4"><img style="width: 479px; height: 618px;" src="../images/sarahwpics/sarahwx+y.jpg" alt="sarahwx+y.jpg"></p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;" class="p4"><big><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sarah used fractions (4 1/2 + 2 1/2) and negative numbers 8 + ⁻1 = 7
quite easily.</b></big><b><big><br>
</big></b></p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;" class="p4"><b><big>2.&nbsp;
When Sarah was adding 2 1/2 + 4 1/2 to get 7 above, Don started a
pattern below: 2x1/2 = 1 = 2/2 , then&nbsp; 3x1/3= 3/3= 1, 4x? =1 … and
Ax? =1 which she answered 1/A, WOW! Then 5x2/5=2.. Don has found this a
powerful idea which can be also used in solving equations like 5y + 3 =
7 -&gt; 5*A/5 + 3 = 7, A=4, so y= 4/5..another way to solve an equation!</big><br>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" class="p4"><big>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; Don asked
Sarah if she could do division. No, she answered. Of course he knew she
could do it! He showed her the 3 ways to write “how many 2’s make 6” or
6 divided by 2 in the “box” on the left below, or “6 divided by 2” as a
fraction, or you share 6 cookies with 2 people, how many would we each
get? He wrote them with the box below:</big></p>

Sarah's #1 quote: "This is like the A above." </span><br style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-family: Arial;">
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-family: Arial;">Sarah was
looking at the x in sin x above, when she realized she had used the A
in Ax1/A = 1 on the previous page. She became aware of the use of a
variable, in the equation and in the division problem (which could be
written as an equation 6 sin x&nbsp; / 2 = 3 sin x )! </span><br style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-family: Arial;">
<span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153); font-family: Arial;"><br>
Don also
used cookie sharing in the problem of how many 2‘s make 65. Sarah knew
that 60/2 was 30. They talked about sharing 5 cookies between 2 of us,
how many cookies would we each get. Cutting the cookies, she found each
of us would get 2 1/2 cookies. So the answer to 65 divided by 2 she
wrote as 32 1/2. See Don’s <a href="http://www.mathman.biz/html/map.html" rel="me" target="_blank"><href="http: www.mathman.biz="" html="" map.html="">A Map to Calculus</href="http:></a>

<p class="p4"><b>Saturday 2 July 2011</b></p>

<p class="p5"><br>
</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We worked on Sarah doing
12x13 in her head with the 100 square and strips.</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Don started Sarah on the infinite
series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +… She got up to 1/128,</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She found
patterns in the bottom number of the fractions (doubling powers of 2) ;</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she found
patterns in the partial sums (the top number is one less than</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bottom
number) and the sum always less than 1. Don asked her , will it ever
fill</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up the
big square? She said <span class="s1"><b>NO!</b></span> Why? There is
always a little space left. It</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets closer
and closer to one.</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Sarah worked on the Peg Game. Don
made a table x being the number of pairs</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of pegs and y
being the number of moves to interchange the colored pegs.</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah filled
in the number of moves to interchange the pegs. She saw a</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pattern in the
differences of the y numbers. We stopped at that point.</p>

<p class="p6"><b>Sunday 3 July 2011</b></p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. We started working on the growth of
the Nautilus shell. Two things happened: Sarah</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't know
about ratios. 80 to 8</p>

<p class="p5"><br>
</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Using the volume relationship
pieces at the sink,&nbsp; Sarah found that 3 cones filled the</p>

<p class="p4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cylinder&nbsp; and 3&nbsp; pyramids filled the cube.</p>

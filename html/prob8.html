<b>Chapter 8</b>: Solving Equations 
and Iteration<hr> <b>1. Make this equation or open sentence true, by
<font color=#ff0000>guessing</font>:</b><br>
This equation can be written different ways. The <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> or 
box is a placeholder, or variable, it just holds the place for a 
number.<br><center><img 
src="../images/whatxy.gif" width="363" height="32"></center><br>We'll try a number for <b>x</b> and 
see if it makes the sentence<font color=#ff0000> 
true. </font> Your job then, if you accept this mission, is to try to 
find a number (<b>x</b>), 
so that when you multiply it by 2, then add 3, you get 
17.<br><center> <img src="../images/try3x.gif" width="407" height="347"></center><br>
<b>Guessing is important, for at least 6 reasons:</b><br>
1). It gets you started right away, even if your guess is wrong the first 
try.<br>
2). It gets you into the problem, you don't have to think "I haven't been 
taught this yet, so I can't do it" attitude and then feel you have to 
wait for someone to tell you how to solve it! <br>
3). You can solve many equations this way, not a trivial few. Don't be 
discouraged if you guess wrong the first few times; keep trying, you can 
do it!<br>
4). You'll also get better at guessing. and<br>
5). You might even come up with different ways to solve the same problem, 
which would be very good! Later we'll solve a quadratic equation about 10 
ways!<br>6). Dr. Richard P. Feynman, Nobel prize-winning physicist in a 
lecture to students said, if you 
want to come up with a new law, you guess what it might be, then test out 
the consequences. <br><font size=4><pre> Now solve these equations (make them true):
			2<b>x</b> + 5 = 13
			2<b>x</b> + 5 = 14
			3<b>x</b> + 7 = 22
			3<b>x</b> + 7 = 23

What could you change if you made up an equation. 
Make up an equation for your Mom or Dad to figure out. 
Make up some equations which have a pattern.

Make up an equation which has <b>a negative number</b> for an answer. 

Make up some equations which have <b>no answers</b>!

Make up some equations so that <b>every number will work</b>!</font></pre>

<b>2. Equations with x's on both sides..by <font 
color=#ff0000>guessing</font></b>:
<br><br>The rule for substitution says 'in any one open sentence with more 
than one of the <b>same variable (x)</b>, you have to put the same number in 
for each'.
<br> Put a number in for <b>x</b> and make this true:  5<b>x</b> + 4 = 
3<b>x</b> + 18<center><img src="../images/sv54318.gif" width="364" height="385"></center><pre>
                   Solve these equations (make them true)
			
			6x + 2 = 3x + 20

			8x + 3 = 4x + 23

			5x + 4 = 3x + 19
</pre>

<b>3. Solving quadratic equations by <font color=#ff0000>guessing</font></b>:
To do these, all you need to know is that 4 squared = 4^2 = 4x4= 16 and 
3-5=-2.<center><img src="../images/gsx^25x6.gif" width="326" height="356"></center>
The second number that works is 2.

solve equations:</b> A washer is what you put in a faucett to keep it 
from leaking, a flat rubber, penny-shaped thing with a hole in it. In 
the picture below, we solve 5x + 3 = 2x + 18. The x becomes a bag of 
washers, and we are trying to figure out how many washers are in each 
bag. We make a balance scale. On the left is 5 bags and 3 loose washers, 
and on the right side is 2 bags and 18 loose washers. The scale is 
balanced to begin with. The idea is to make the problem simpler by taking 
off bags from both sides or loose ones from both sides, the same from 
both sides, to keep the scale balanced: <center><img 
src="../images/balpic.gif" width="387" height="419"></center><br>Make up some equations like the 
one above, and solve them by making a balance picture for each.

</span></b></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">Don saw a videotape
of Nobel prize-winning Physicist Richard Feynman's lecture about making up a
theory. He said the first thing one needs to do is </span><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#FF6600">GUESS</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">
</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">what it should be. His students
giggled at this, but it was very important he said. Then one had to test the
quess, do some experiments, and if it didn't work throw it away! So when Don has
his students guessing to solve equations, he feels confident that he is going in
the right direction.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-weight:

</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">telling us,</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="font-family:Arial"> </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#FF6600">guessing
is very important, for at least 5 reasons:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#FF6600">
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">1) you start off
right away. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">2) it gets you into
the problem, you don't have to have this &quot;I haven't been taught this, so I
can't do it &quot; attitude and then feel you have to wait for someone to tell
you how to solve it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">3) you can solve
many equations this way, not a trivial few, as well as solving other types of
problems. Don't be discouraged if you guess wrong the first few times; keep
trying, you can do it. Along with guessing goes the question-are you getting
closer? Is the guess too big or too small?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">4) you'll also get
better at guessing. And <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">5) you might even
come up with different ways to solve the same problem, which would be very good.
Then <b>you</b> would have a check to tell you if you are right or not, like
when taking a test, and without having to rely on someone else to tell you.</span></p>

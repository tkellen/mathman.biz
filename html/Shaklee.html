  <font color="#ff0000">The Shaklee 50th Anniversary Dietary Supplement Study</font>
  done by The UC Berkeley School of Public Health, gives us proof that people
  using multiple Shaklee vitamins and nutritional supplements for 20 years, had
  a lower incidence of cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure, and markedly
  better health, than those taking other brands of multivitamins, or <u>no</u>
  nutritional supplements at all.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  With Dr. Shaklee’s 50 year legacy of innovation, and based on 12 Shaklee
  clinical studies, Shaklee scientists combined 80 bio-optimized nutrients, into

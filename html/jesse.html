<p align="left">Don started Jesse on continued fractions, which leads to an
infinite continued fraction and the Golden Mean. Don showed him where to start
(with the 1+1). And they talked about the reciprocal of a fraction 1<font size="4"><b>/</b></font>3/2
= 2/3, because 3/2 x 2/3 = 1. They did the following:</p>

<p align="left">Don had Jesse keep track of the answers as improper fractions,
then mixed numbers and decimals. Changing fractions to decimals was new to him,
but he went a long way.</p>

<p align="left">Jesse explains his method of changing an improper fraction to a
mixed number. In the example below he starts with 9/5. He left out that he puts
the 4 on top:</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Jesse used his method for the ones above. Don never saw this
before! Don had Jesse do one like 12/5 = 1 7/5, and then Don had him continue
till he got a proper fraction in the mixed number 2 2/5.</p>

<p align="left">Notice that the numbers they got for the continued fractions
were alternating!</p>

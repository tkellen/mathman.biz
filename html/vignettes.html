<p><font face="Arial" size="4">1. Mark is a physicist (among other things) and
the father of Kaitlin, one of Don's students. Kaitlin, a 4th grader, made up a
quadratic equation for Don, after doing five or six herself. Then when her Dad
came to pick her up, she gave it to her Dad to do. The equation she made up was</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">x<sup>2&nbsp; </sup>-12x + 32 = 0</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Now Caitlin knew the answers were 8
and 4, because she figured out the secrets, that&nbsp; 8x4 = 32 and 8+4 =12.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Mark did this: he subtracted 32 from
each side, then factored the x out on the left. So he had</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">x<sup>2&nbsp; </sup>-12x = <sup>-</sup>
32&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4">x(x-12) =&nbsp; <sup>-</sup> 32</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;He then figured that 8 would
work because 8*(8 -12) = 8* <sup>-</sup> 4 = <sup>-</sup> 32</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">and 4 works also because 4* <sup>-</sup>
8 = <sup>-</sup> 32.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Another way to solve a quadratic
equation! Don has about 10 ways to solve a quadratic equation in his books (See
Ch. 8).</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">2. Olivia, a 6th grader, found the
ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers 1/1=1, 2/1 = 2, 3/2 = 1 1/2 = 1.5, going
out to 610/377 = 1.61803713528. Then she and Don looked this number up in David
Wells' book &quot;The Penguin Dictionary of CURIOUS and INTERESTING
NUMBERS&quot; which gives this number as
1.6180339887498948482045868343656381177030917980576... Olivia said &quot;the
number gets bigger and bigger and approaches 2&quot;. Don said, &quot;Yes, but
it also approaches 1.7 &quot;.&nbsp; [This is where the discussion had to end,
but it&nbsp; will continue.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">3. Anna, a 5th grader, wanted to
know how to do this subtraction</font></p>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp; 7.98</font><br>
<font face="Arial" size="4">- 8.653941</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="4">Don had never had a student ask
about a problem like this, so he knew he was going to learn something.</font></p>

By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot;&nbsp;a few years ago for my
8 year-old daughter, who is now in Grade 3 of an International School in ___.
And so she can communicate with anybody in English for her age. I hope that she
will work/study with you for around one week of this summer in 2007 and this
experience will be wonderful for her. Therefore I have some inquiries to ask.&nbsp;
Where in Champaign will she stay and can she alone stay there or is any parent
needed to accompany her while all staying days? And is it possible for her to
continue any other summer camp programs (e.g. sports or language course) held in
Champaign for another week? Thank you for your kindness in advance. I wish that
Champaign's summer days would come true.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#800000">I
had a wonderful session with Nanako. We worked on infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 +1/8
+... (see chapter 1 in my worksheet book). She shared 1 cake (an 8x8 square) between the two
of us, each getting 1/2, see her picture below:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/nanakoinfser1-2.jpg" width="587" height="819"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#800000">We
talked about 1/2 of 1/2 = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, 31/32 &lt; 1, 2/4=1/2,
2/8 = 1/4. Along the way when, after some thought, she said 1/2 + 1/4 = 1/6, we
looked at the picture and we discussed the fact that 2/4 = 1/2&nbsp; so 1/2 +
1/4= 2/4+1/4 and she knew this to be 3/4; I also went back to talk about which
is bigger 1/2 or 1/4? she knew that 1/2 &gt; 1/4 and 1/4&gt;1/6 so if she added
1/2 + 1/4 she couldn't get a smaller number like 1/6 (unless we had negative
numbers). The point is that when I get an answer from a student that is
incorrect, I don't say &quot;that's wrong&quot;, sometimes I will show them what
the problem is that has their answer, in other words the question that her
answer is the right answer to <font size="4">and/or</font>&nbsp; I have them
look at the picture to see what really works. She found the partial sums 1/2 +
1/4 = 3/4, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8 ...and 1023/1024.. what's happening? started
graphing the partial sums.<br>
<br>
<br>
I also talked with Nanako's Mum, as we worked, to explain what I was doing -like
looking for </font><font size="4" color="#000000">patterns,</font><font color="#800000">
a very important idea. For example, in the denominators and numerators of the
partial sums&nbsp; 1/2,&nbsp; 3/4,&nbsp; 7/8, ...&nbsp; - how do you get from 2
to 4 to 8, ... she first said add 2, but she realized that didn't work, then she
said to add the number 2+2=4, 4+4=8,...which is correct, and I showed her that
4+4 = 2*4 =8 and 8+8= 2*8=16,.. so you are doubling each time. I also showed her
how to multiply 16*2 going from left to right- 2*10 = 20 and 2*6=12 so 20+12= 32
in her head! and 2*32 = 2*30 + 2*2 = 60+4=64. How do you get from the bottom
number (denominator) to the top number (numerator); and are the partial sums
increasing, decreasing or remaining the same; Nanako said they are increasing,
and they were always smaller than 1!</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial"><font color="#800000">Nanako
worked on the Tower Puzzle and she took it back to the hotel until tomorrow. I
had to remind her that I was 119 years old and she would have to speak a little
louder. We looked at my family pictures, looked at the actual Nautilus shells I
have, and my painting of the shell which then became my logo on my books and on
my website. I also found (as many children do) her answering me with a question
&quot;seven eighths?&quot; I tried to get her to realize that she really knew it
was that and should say it positively. It is a matter of confidence, which I
want her to feel. I think she was confused sometimes and I told her that that
was alright to be confused but we'll work on that. I think most people are
confused about a lot of things, and make mistakes, and that's human.<br>
<br>
I also enjoyed Nanako's Mum. She wanted to help
Nanako, as many parents tend to do, because they want to help their child get
the right answers.. but I want the student to figure things out themselves. I
had to muzzle her - in a nice way, of course, and we laughed about it! Mum
learned some things also. She brought a Japanese book to read, but she was too
interested in what Nanako and I were working on to do any reading.</font></span></b></p>

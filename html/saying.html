<p class="MsoNormal">The guy who made this web site, <a href="/">http://www.mathman.biz/</a>,
is one of my clients and also a friend of mine.&nbsp; I fix his computers and
help him to use them to teach math.&nbsp; He teaches math in a way that is
really fun.&nbsp; Sometimes math in school gets to be really hard to learn, and
it's not very much fun.&nbsp; Don make it really easy!&nbsp; Some of the kids
that learn math from Don get to be really smart.&nbsp; The way Don teaches math,
it's more like playing with puzzles than doing homework.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you wanted to, you could talk to Don on the phone, and
he could help you learn some things from one of the books he wrote.&nbsp; He
could help you learn math by talking to you through email and maybe even talk to
you through a microphone on the computer with a video camera that shows up on
the screen!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember though...&nbsp; This is only for kids that want to
grow up to be really smart.&nbsp; People that are really good at math when they
grow up get to have really fun jobs.&nbsp; Jayna is really good at math, but
sometimes she had to work really hard to learn it in college.&nbsp; Now she gets
to do some neat experiments in college.&nbsp; They are even giving her money to
go to school!&nbsp; If you start learning more math now, then it might be really
easy for you when you get to be as old as Jayna.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on <a href="/">http://www.mathman.biz/</a>
to visit Don's site, and maybe he can help you have some fun with math!&nbsp; I
will send a copy of this email to Don so that he knows that you might give him a
telephone call.</p>

We feel he enjoys and understands numbers fairly well.&nbsp; Our aim is to

<p align="left">&quot;..What Brad just discovered [in his cookie-sharing from
Chapter 2], explains Don Cohen- a.k.a. The Mathman, and author of this absorbing
little book- is an infinite series. From just such simple investigative
beginnings, Cohen shepherds young (and older) learners into the beauties and
complexities of higher mathematics. Using models, projects, puzzles, pictures,
calculators, and self-written computer programs, kids explore many of the
classic problems of mathematics- how did Archimedes figure out the area enclosed
by a curve?- and discover the principles of functions, integrals, slopes and
derivatives, the secrets of the snowflake curves, and the fascinations of the
Fibonacci numbers. The book itself is tiny- spiral bound, 3 3/4x5&quot; - but
the concepts it encloses are immense. There's an accompanying (and much larger)
Worksheets book with [questions leading to the concepts], additional problem
suggestions, examples, and [student ] illustrations, plus reproducible graph
papers and a detailed bibliography. ..&quot;--&nbsp; from the review of Don's
books by Becky Rupp in the July/August 2000 issue of <i><b>Home Education

<p><font color="#ff0000">The Japanese translation of Don's book &quot;Calculus
By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot;, done 8 years ago by Ms.
Noriko Arai of Hiroshima City U., was in bookstores all over Japan beginning on
August 20, 1998. The book was published by <a href="http://www.bookclub.kodansha.co.jp/Scripts/bookclub/blue/blue.idc?isbn=257224-9">Kodansha,
in their BLUE BACKS series</a>, and has sold over 15,000 copies in 1 1/3 years!
<p>On Sept. 6, 1998, three weeks after publication, Don received the following
email from Kodansha:<br>
&quot;..And now I have good news to tell you. We are going to print additional
2,000 copies late this month. <b>We can say that your method was accepted to
Japanese people as a kind of new text in which they could learn and understand
math much more than ever before&quot;.</b></font>
<p>Nov. '98 -&quot; .. I found the ways that those young people approached the
problems to be very novel and inspiring. The infinite continued fraction
solution to the quadratic equation was especially intriguing and beautiful. I
was also impressed by the effort and tenacity displayed by one boy who was doing
the infinite series of fractions when he wasn't even aware of the rules of
fraction addition. Thank you for the wonderful books..&quot;- Perple, math
teacher in CA.
<p><font color="#009900">July 2, 1998- &quot;I have been telling myself for
years that I was going to teach myself calculus. I knew that it would have to be
put in simple terms. I looked at the libraries, book stores and colleges for
some kind of workbook that would enable me to teach myself. One year, I bought
&quot;Schaum's Beginner's Calculus&quot; that included Don's brochure. I thought
WOW! NEAT! I needed to preview the book, though. Eventually after getting on the
internet I came across Don's web page. He had sample problems from each chapter
on his web sight. As I looked at each problem I thought, &quot;Anyone can do
this!&quot; I was sold. I got the book and went through it in about 2 weeks. Now
I am enrolled in a correspondence calculus course and my grade is 96%! Don's
book helped me understand the CONCEPTS better that any other workbook I have
purchased. I also gave the problems to my young relatives , the neighbor kids,
any kid I can get my hands on. They just love doing them. This book is great for
people of all ages. All the people who went through life afraid of math will be
cured when they go through Don's worksheet book. It's a must have.&quot;<br>

<h3>More exciting news!!</h3>
Mary Pride in her new '99 issue of 'The Big Book of Home Learning' had this to
say about Don's materials:&quot;..And that's what this series is about. Playing
with interesting aspects of math- the Fibonacci sequence, for example- and
learning to think mathematically. None of these materials offer a step-by-step
instructional sequence, like a regular math course. Instead, these are <i>explorations</i>
in math, a veritable hands-on museum of activities for young children in areas
where high-school students fear to tread.&quot;</font>
<hr>A teacher writes:<br>
&quot;Don Cohen's class was superb! Seeing him teach; being taught; and taking
this information to my classroom has greatly enriched my students and me. Don's
worksheet book has been easy to follow and adapted to my own needs and
situations. I actually tore out the worksheet book pages and put them in a
spiral notebook, fitting in my work between the appropriate pages. The 'toys'
have been great manipulatives for all my students to enjoy and apply to math.
His library has been of great value to me. Two thumbs up!&quot; Patricia Plaut,
5th grade teacher. Unit 4 District, Champaign, IL.<hr>Don's book was reviewed in FACHINFORMATIONSZENTRUM<br> 
KARLSRUHE No. 5/<b>90</b> in Germany.<hr>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">About Don's 'Math By Mail':</font></center></h3>
&quot;Don Cohen's Math by Mail has been a wonderful and fun enrichment for our
son Grant, who has learned more about higher math than otherwise possible for
his age&quot;--<b>Dr. and Mrs. Stan Kolar</b>, OK<br>
&quot;(I'm too busy to eat right now)&quot;--<b>Grant Kolar</b>, while doing one
of Don's problems, and &quot;Don is an alright dude&quot;. Grant corresponded
with Don for two years, and came to study with him twice during the summer of
'90, between the two years. Grant started with Don at age 11, then he skipped
7th grade and as an 8th grader was tops in his algebra 2 class. Some of Grant's
work is in Don's worksheet book. In '99 Grant was in medical school.<br>
<p><center><font color="#0000ff">About Don's Videotapes:</font></center></p>
&quot;What to conventional wisdom appears either impossible or unlikely, this
tape and my class's experiences with it, demonstrate that the main concepts
presented here are not only possible with young children but fun, engaging and
eminently practical. The tape (VT #1) integrates a wide spectrum of math
concepts with critical thinking to solve really important math problems. Don
uses concrete examples to help children find patterns in the process&quot;. --<b>Douglas
Elrick, 4th-5th grade teacher, </b>and father of three of Don's former students.
<p><br>
&quot;..seldom do I see students so excited about their discoveries and sharing
their methods..What's more exciting, they want to get a hold of some little kids
and try it out on theme..&quot;--<b>Bruce Hamilton, HS math teacher, </b>Colorado
Springs School, CO (One of Bruce's student has their discovery in Don's
worksheet book).
<p><br>
&quot;The Cohen videotape on infinite series is an excellent inservice for
teachers. The tape demonstrates how to engage children's minds and shows
alternate ways to study mathematics other than workbook
fill-in-the-blanks&quot;.--<b>Marjorie Klein, kindergarten teacher </b>and
mother of two of Don's students.
<p><br>
&quot;..Especially appealing is your non-threatening approach where analytical
concepts, such as geometrical series, are made visually understandable to young
children in terms of what they can grasp..Congratulations on an excellent
achievement. I can strongly recommend and endorse this educational tool to all
ages. Even my university level students could benefit from an exposure to your
concepts&quot;.--<b> Richard E. Klein, PH.D., Associate Professor of Mechanical
Engineering, </b>and father of two of Don's students.
<p><br>
&quot;If you've never had algebra, this half hour tape (VT#2) will teach you the
basics of functions and iteration. It will show you how to do iteration by hand
or with a calculator. You'll see that even children of ages 6 and 7 can solve
iteration problems&quot;. --<b>John Zarella, Microcomputer Applications</b>

Worksheet books:</font></h3>
</center><br>
&quot;..In summary: when Beth (age 8) received your little book, she didn't want
to go to bed that night. When your Worksheets arrived, she didn't want to go to
school either! It's hard for plain old school to compete with the intellectual
excitement of your ideas. Your approach to helping children build their own
understanding of mathematics will profoundly affect their lives. Cheers.&quot;--<b>Meg
Bennett</b>, Meg Bennett's Almanac, 2255 Algonquin Rd., Niskayuna, NY 12309 (Meg
is now <font color="#ff0000">homeschooling</font> Beth)<br>

&quot;.. Much lip service is given to education as it ought to be. Your
materials guide us to education at its best. It's always exciting and rewarding
to work with your materials.&quot; -- <b>Debbie Reese, former TAG teacher</b>,
grades 6-8, IA <font color="#8800ff">(Debbie and her students found 3 mistakes
in Don's worksheet book! Needless to say, she and her students have really
worked hard and carefully in the Worksheet book.)</font>
<p>&quot;..I've been using Don's worksheet book at home with two 10-year olds
and an 8-year old. Don's books and videos are at once the most sophisticated and
the most down to earth step-by-step exciting stuff I have yet to find..&quot;--<b>Barnett
J. Weiss, Brooklyn, NY</b>
<p>&quot;Dear Don, I have been using your &quot;Calculus By and For Young
People&quot; for two years, and I love it. I was able to convince my Gifted and
Talented Education committee to adopt the program as a semi-official program for
our small district. CB&amp;FYP works equally well for children who prefer to
work along and equally well for co-operative learning... Given the appalling
state of general math education in the country, your book is a bright candle in
the darkness.&quot; -- <b>W. Matera, elementary math teacher, CA</b>
<p><br>
&quot;..We are certainly enjoying your Calculus book and worksheets. We agree:
&quot;This book is not a 1 year course!&quot; Thank you for the joy and light
which permeate these books.&quot; -- <b>K. T. Cooper, RI,</b> who with his wife,<font color="#ff0000">
homeschool</font> their 11, 9, and 7 year old children
<p><br>
&quot;..Cohen shows us clear, easy-to-follow steps how some of his students have
tackled problems such as sharing 6 cookies evenly with 7 people, which leads to
a discussion of infinite series and alternative methods of problem-solving..Cohen's
approach to his subject seems likely to defuse the fears of the most
calculus-phobic person willing to stick with him. Impressive!&quot;--reviewed by
<b>Bruce Kodisch </b>in the September 1993 The Institute of General Semantics
Newletter
<p><br>
<font color="#0000ff">&quot;..On my first toe dipping into your hand book (child
size), chapter 1 Infinite Series and skipping for a quick look at what integral
calculus is about, how 'on looking into Chapman's Homer' it all is - how
aesthetically pleasing it all is. The beauty of the obvious, once you have been
shown!</font>--<b> Dr. M. Greenberg </b>, England&quot;
<p>&quot;..But the main attractiveness (of Don's book) is due to an explicit
philosophy that children are capable of behaving as mathematicians. ..Somehow we
reach an almost formal treatment of integration and differentiation without an
integral sign or a dy/dx. But on the way we have been presented with a variety
of very accessible problems. ..&quot; --reviewed by <b>David Fielker</b> in the
Sept. '92 <b><i>Mathematics Teaching </i></b>(England)
<p>&quot;..many fresh and revealing insights..a very handy resource..&quot; --
July '93 <i><b>Undergraduate Mathematics Education Trends, </i></b>a newsletter
of the MAA and AMS
<p>&quot;I was an A students in calculus, but after seeing the work of Don Cohen
and his students, I am finally beginning to understand infinite series. This
style of work should be part of all calculus courses&quot;.--<b>Kevin Kopchynski,
mathematics teacher, </b>elementary - high school, Wilbraham, MA.
<p><br>
&quot;I really loved your book! It gave me lots of ideas how to make calculus
more fun for my students, and how to relate the excitement of Mathematics to my
own children..&quot;--<b>Doron Zeilberger, mathematics professor, </b>Drexel
University.
<p>&quot;..packed with many problems that can be used in almost any
classroom..&quot; --<b> Leonard Yutkins, </b>Oct.'89, <b><i>Mathematics Teacher </b></i>(NCTM)
<p>&quot;..Cohen believes strongly in learning mathematics, not by memorizing
formulas and notation, but by truly understanding and enjoying it..&quot;
--&quot;Oct. 89 <b><i>Educational Leadership </b></i>(ASCD)
<p>&quot;..I think it will slowly become as popular as it deserves and I hope
that it will help many innocent victims of Bourbarki to recover their mental
balance..&quot; --<b> Manuel Ojanguren,</b> Institut de Mathematiques,
Universite de Lausanne, Switzerland
<p>&quot;..intriguing little book..The author has a delightful attitude about
teaching and learning..&quot;--review in May-June'89 issue of <b><i>Home
Education Magazine.</b></i>
<p>&quot;I am glad you are emphasizing that young children can do maths.&quot;
--<b> W. W. Sawyer,</b> author and mathematics teacher, Cambridge, England.
<p>&quot;..stimulating little book..you are to be congratulated for your
daring..&quot; --<b> Morris Kline, </b>author and mathematics teacher, NYC.
<p>&quot;..very well done..&quot;--<b>Martin Gardner</b>, author and former
writer of Mathematical Recreations articles in Scientific American
<p>&quot;This book raises questions for all educators concerning the extent to
which students in elementary school should be introduced to problems involving
limits of infinite sequences and series.. Cohen's book is puzzling, troubling,
provoking, but interesting. Read it.&quot;-- Raymond E. Spaulding, in the May

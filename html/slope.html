<p align="left">Notice that both slopes are negative because each graph is like
this \. For 7x+2y=22 she found the slope from (0, 7 1/3) to (4,<sup>-</sup>2) =
rise/run= the change in y = <b><font size="4"><sup>-</sup></font></b>(7 1/3 - <sup>-</sup>2)

the y goes down 3 when the x goes up 4, so the slope is </font><font color="#CC0000"><sup>-</sup>3/4</font><font color="#000000">.</font></p>

<p align="left">Anna made up a rule x<b><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font></b> -
2x +1 and graphed it. She saw the differences.</p>

<p align="left">She wrote: a curve is different from a straight line because on
a graph a curve goes up by different numbers (1, 3, 5, 7,..-<b> the slope
changes</b>) but a straight line
goes up (or down) by the same amount. As in Emily's graph, for the black line, the y goes down
by the same amount&nbsp; <sup><b>-</b></sup> 2 1/3 as x goes up&nbsp; 1).</p>


<p align="left">When Anna came in this week she and Don talked about the slope
of a line. When they finished, she wrote &quot;the change in y <b><font size="5">/</font></b>change
in x&nbsp; = the slope&quot;! Don asked Anna if she could think of a way to find
the slope of her curve (the slope of the tangent) at the point (3,4). We'll see
what she comes up with- Don hopes Mom doesn't give too much away.</p>


<p align="left">So how do we find the slope of a curve? By finding the <font color="#FF0000"><b>slope
of the tangent line</b></font> to the curve at any point on the curve- this is
called <font color="#FF0000"><b>the</b></font> <b><font color="#FF0000">derivative</font></b><font color="#000000">
OR by zooming in on a curve at some point, when the curve looks like a straight
line, then find the slope of the line at that point.</font></p>

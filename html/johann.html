<p align="left"><font color="#008000">Via telephone, Don and Johann's Mom Svava, talked about how to
proceed in developing a program for him. Svava purchased Don's book
&quot;Calculus By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot; from
amazon.com, his book &quot;Calculus By and For Young People - Worksheets&quot;
from Don, and his 2 videotapes from Rainbow resource Center. She would like
Johann to start working with Don. It turns out that Johann can count to
200, can write numerals to 10 and count back from 10 to zero, cannot add as
such. He went to Kumon at 3 years old. These were some agreed upon things to start with:</font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">Dear Don,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">Here is the report for the first two days of our math
lessons.&nbsp; I will fax his sheets to you for the first week or so, or until I
get my equipment up. [see above]<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">In the summer we had a daily schedule on our refrigerator
in which he had to do crawling 10 times per day.&nbsp; He was really good at
adding and subtracting throughout the day how many rounds were left or completed
and he put an X every time he completed a round.&nbsp; This was very effortless
for him and I asked him all the time, &quot;ok Johann you've done so many trips,
now how many do you have left&quot;.&nbsp; He would always answer me even if he
didn't have the schedule in front of him.&nbsp; Now sitting down with him is a
whole different story.&nbsp; He just is taking his time getting the concept of
addition and when I added subtraction this morning thinking it's really the same
thing and the two should be done at the same time he was really confused.&nbsp;
We will continue to play the SUM SWAMP addition/subtraction game we have played
in the past but now we will play it more consistently, for now every day.&nbsp;
Yesterday I may have given him too much - but what is too much???&nbsp; For
addition we drew a number line and worked with it for a while and then we also
used manipulatives.&nbsp; His concept is much better in an informal setting than
when sitting down with numbers and signs.&nbsp; He understood the ball concept
pretty well.&nbsp; I told him it's better to just write the number in front of
the balls to represent the quantity and he understood that quite well (instead
of drawing up many balls).&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">The cookies I asked him to divide 6 between me and him and
he gave me 2 and himself 2 and he wanted to do nothing with the rest, well
finally he figured it out and today he divided 7 cookies between the two of us
without a problem.&nbsp; He tore the paper in half and I told him it's called
one tooth.&nbsp; Today I started with doing addition.&nbsp; We used his fingers,
manipulatives and the number line.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">When I moved to doing square + triangle = 4 he was totally
lost. I wonder if addition and subtraction doesn't have to click completely
before he can do graphing? Or am I teaching it wrong? Or should I just show him
so he can fill in the axis?&nbsp; I feel a little lost at how I can make the
concept click with him, I feel there has to be a way without just memorizing,
some say it's developmental and perhaps he hasn't reached that stage yet.&nbsp;
But I feel very confident that he is ready because of the chart we did in the
summer, but how can I help him<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>make
sense of addition and subtraction so it's effortless?&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">Sorry this is so long but in the beginning I think it's
rather important to know where his mind is.&nbsp; Perhaps I need to find ways to
teach him math where he can involve his whole body instead of sitting down
looking at a piece of paper.&nbsp; Perhaps there are ways I can organize (it
would have to be organized because I'm too scatterbrained for anything else) it
into our daily activities and I'm thinking about it.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">What are your thoughts on all this?&nbsp; Perhaps It's just
normal starting stress I'm going through? Who knows.&nbsp; Thanks for all that
you do, I know we chose the best place to go for help.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#008000">P.S.&nbsp; I bought the tower puzzle, the wooden geoboard
(the 10&quot;, they didn't have the 8&quot;), colored rubber bands, cuisenaire

Dear Svava,<br>
<br>
It's getting late for me, this being my first week back with the kids... i need
more time to read your email. Two things pop out right away..<br>
<br>
1. Could there be a place on a floor where you could make the axes (masking
tape?) and he could walk to 3,1 and put something there (maybe a washer?
cookie?).<br>
<br>
2. How about the language &quot;share 6 cookies between 2 people&quot;. I know
this is really a way to look at division.<br>
<br>
3. The pen or pencil used for adding 4+2=6 on the number line was much darker
and better for reproduction on a fax or scanner. A black colored pencil?<br>
<br>
4. I liked what you did with the balls!<br>
<br>
5. his writing numerals is very good.<br>
<br>
6. Look at what I did with Tessa at five..at <a href="/html/tlc1+1.html">http://www.mathman.biz/html/tlc1+1.html</a>&nbsp;
You read the left side&nbsp; , like 1+1= one plus one equals what? one ten plus
one ten = what? and so on. I bet he'll love doing 1 million + 1 million= ? and 1
sine x + 1 sine x =&nbsp; ?<br>
<br>
7. Have him make a soma set with the 1cm<sup>3</sup> . See <a href="/html/olivia.html">Olivia</a>'s
drawing of the 7&nbsp; pieces. If this is not clear, I'll send you a set for him
to reproduce by gluing the cm cubes to make the 7 pieces.<br>
<br>
You're doing fine, Svava. Go to a different thing if he is confused or doesn't
care to do it. Don't force it..use a light touch..</font></p>

We used plastic manipulative bears to put inside the square and the
triangle to represent the different values for each [pair of numbers]. We did make a graph but we used the squares in our kitchen floor and
masking tape to represent the axes. Johann walked the axes and also used his
fingers (we did both) and then he drew a line thru his points (which he marked
with a little tape) using yarn that he taped down. For now this works better
than sitting down at a table.&quot;&nbsp;

<br><font size="3">Hi Don<br>Johann's web page looks awsome!&nbsp; He is very proud of
it.&nbsp; Today went really well.&nbsp; We made the graph except I think I'd
like to use X and Y instead of the square and the triangle, because it's
confusing to have a y-axis and plotting a triangle in on it.&nbsp; So today I
called Y-axis a<o:p>
</o:p>
 &quot;triangle&nbsp;line&quot; but now I think I will change it for next time.&nbsp;
Is that OK?&nbsp; Sum Swamp went really well and he is preferring to use his
fingers sometimes over using the bears because using the fingers is faster.&nbsp;So
my thinking is if he wants to do things faster his understanding <o:p>
</o:p>
must be better.&nbsp; In regards to the numbers he can write, he can actually
write numbers up to 120 or even 200.&nbsp; Tonight I will get out a number chart
and tomorrow we will start practicing counting the way you taught us, I will
include the fractions (although he won't understand what he is reciting) so he
will be more familiar with them when we start using them.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am so sorry but unfortunately I got your message this
morning.&nbsp; We would have loved to see you and your math room.&nbsp; Perhaps
we'll get another chance soon.&nbsp; I have been thinking in the past week if
there are any worksheets you could provide us with.&nbsp; This last week we have</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">been working on two beginners math books and it's very
basic.&nbsp; He did counting down and writing which numbers come before and
after, skip counting, odd and even numbers, more or less and so forth.&nbsp; I
did get your package, thanks a lot, I took out the yellow strips and asked him
to count the squares in a single strip.&nbsp; We now call ten - onety.&nbsp; I
put the strips down and say for example &quot;what is onety + onety&quot; and
his answer was &quot;twoty&quot;.&nbsp; He immediately got the concept and we
practiced all kinds of combinations.&nbsp; I'd like to have a daily plan worked
out for</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">him in addition to those basic books (which probably
aren't even that good) that we are using right now.&nbsp; The plan I'd like to
come up with (if it seems like a good idea to you) is consistently working on
different concepts on different days and repeating often enough a concept
(drill) so that it starts to make sense.&nbsp; The strips are just
a great way, I saw immediately how we can work on those using different
problems.&nbsp; I would like to give our studies some structure though.&nbsp; I
think some type of a daily plan will work the best (4 maybe 5 days per week).&nbsp;
How</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">would you like us to use the dotted paper?&nbsp; Could you
give us some examples of how to use it?&nbsp; Do we draw different shapes like
the examples on the website using&nbsp; paintcans and coloring in different
colors for each square?&nbsp; We need to do some more cookie problems this week also<br> Thanks again, oh and we do not have a
web cam.&nbsp; I'll see about buying one soon.&nbsp; We do have a microphone so that would work
and we have used it with MSN messenger. :-) Svava</p>
<p><b>21 Jan. 2003 Don &amp; Svava talk on the telephone for an hour! They
discussed:</b><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>1.</b> Worksheets- that schools give children worksheets
and worksheets to keep the kids busy or for drill. Don's worksheet book is
different; it gives questions leading to the concept, or getting his students to
look for patterns.<b><o:p>
</o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>2. Make a math book for Johann. </b>Take <b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></b>
sheets of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>8 ' x 11' plain paper,
fold in half as above, and staple down the middle (2 or 3 staples).This gives 8
writing surfaces. This idea is from the best teacher Don has ever seen, Sue
Monell at The Bank Street School for Children in NYC.Title it 'Johann's math
book #1'. On each page put a type of problem he will work on, maybe <b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:#993300">one
example</span></b>. And, <b><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:#993300">very
important</span></b>, leave room on each page for him to make up more problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This will be like drill for him, but it's not someone else's problems
he's working on. This will help Johann think about: what kind of numbers to
use, what operation he can use, how big can the numbers be, what are the
directions for the problem.. It turns out Johann has made books about his study
of space, so this will fit right in with Svava's plan for him. Svav has read
many, many books and articles for homeschooling and this idea about Johann's
math book is perfect for what she wants for him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b>With
the geoboard he can make shapes, copy them to the spotty paper, then find the
area within the shape (how many cans of paint does it take to paint inside the
figure. (See chapter 14).<o:p>

Svava agreed to send Don the work that Johann has been doing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>6. </b>Both Svava and Paul, Johann's Dad, are very
pleased with Johann's work so far!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Then Svava took a break to have a baby girl, Soley. She
wrote in July that they wanted to bring Johann to work with Don in Champaign! </font> </b>Svava,
Johann and Soley came Sunday <font color="#000000"><b> August 24, 2003</b></font> and would stay a group session on
Saturday August 30.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Johann worked on graphing x+y=5. The peg game (this was
difficult for him). Svava figured it out and Johann took it with him overnight
to work on at the hotel. He worked on adding tens using the 10-strips. Then the
next day did multiplying 1x10= , 2x10 = up to 12x10= 120. He also made up
problems like 1x8=8, 1x10=10,..</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Don made up an equation using a box instead of an x. He
made up 2xBox = 6. He said 5. Don asked what 2 5's was. He said 10. So Don said
he had the right answer to a different problem 2xBox = 10!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Johann worked on the iron heart puzzle and the Tower puzzle
with 3 and 4 disks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Johann started to add 101starting with 404, 505, 606, 707,
808, 909, then got 100010. They talked about 1000 + 10 = 1010. And don did some
work with him using the base 3 Dienes blocks, adding 212 + 121, and although
Johann wasn't interested in this, Svava was and she came away from this ready to
do this with him herself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Don worked with Johann on coloring in 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4, but
1/8 was a problem, so they stopped there. Johann filled a cone with water 3
times to fill a cylinder. He said the volume of the cone is 1/3 the volume of
the cylinder. Don used the Geoblocks to have Johann figure out how many of
different blocks made other larger ones</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Johann did a little work on division. What is ' ? he
asked. Don said it meant , like how many 2's make 6? and showed him the ways to
write this&nbsp; 2)6&nbsp;&nbsp; 6'2 = 3 and 6/2=3.&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal"> Johann added 10's on the
100 card. 2-&gt;12, 3-&gt;13..10-&gt;20.&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal"> He made the 7 Soma pieces and with the
help of Olivia's sheet, built the cube.&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal"> He did some graphing, like x + y = 6.&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal"> And
he did some cookie-sharing, like share 1 cookie between 2 people, each person
gets 1/2 (one-twoth). Then he said that 1/3 is smaller than 1/2.
<p class="MsoNormal">Johann spent 10- 15 group sessions and a couple of
individual sessions with Don. Everyone was pleased with the work Johann had done
with Don.
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font size="4" color="#FF00FF"><b>Fine job,
Johann!!</b></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Another
outcome of their visit is that Johann's Dad would see that Don's books are put
on a disc and be printed less costly! Thank you all!</font></b><hr>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Oct. 9, 2002 </b>Daly started working with Don
on this day. His Mom teaches 5th grade and had two of Don's students from the
past. It turned out that Daly's 3rd grade teacher Don had in the MAT program at Webster
College in St. Louis in 1968!!&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Don started Daly working on the square numbers,
then looking at the differences:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalysqnos.gif" width="494" height="397"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"> Don found Daly knew about square
numbers, like 3<sup>2</sup> = 9 now, and negative numbers, like 4 - 5 = <sup>-</sup>1
so he started Daly working on solving quadratic equations: &nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalyquad.gif" width="499" height="621"><font size="3">
 &nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">
He found the two solutions for x<sup>2</sup>-8x+15=0,&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup>-7x+10=0,&nbsp;
x<sup>2</sup>-10x+24=0, x<sup>2</sup>-11x+24=0,&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup>-25x+24=0
and&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup>-6 1/2x+9=0. In this last one he found out how to
multiply 3 x 3 1/2 which he finally figured out to be 10 1/2 and finally figured
out the 2 answers are 2 and 4 1/2. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Oct. 16, 2002 </b></font>Daly made up a
quadratic equation for Don, above. Daly worked on <font size="3">Daly worked on graphing equations, like x + y = 8
where he got into fractions and negative numbers below.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalyx+y=8.gif" width="517" height="645"></p>

<p align="left">Daly also graphed x+y=12. And he multiplied 2 1/2 X 3 1/2 = 8
3/4 by counting the pieces in the diagram below:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalymultmixed.gif" width="356" height="329"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">On<b> October 23, 2002 </b></font>Don started
Daly on an infinite series</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalyinfser12.gif" width="510" height="642"></p>

<p align="left">He realized that <img align="middle" src="../images/bw12164.gif" width="194" height="27">goes
to 1. Notice Daly's last piece is 1/412, but underneath he had the right number
512.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">On<b> October 30, 2002 </b></font>Don asked Daly
to do <img align="middle" src="../images/is13181.gif" width="127" height="28">and Don not being clear,
Daly did 1/2 of 1/3, instead of 1/3 of 1/3: he did the rest correctly, and at
some point Don will have Daly&nbsp; work on this to find where it goes. Do you
know?</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalyinfser13.gif" width="523" height="828"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">On<b> November 6 &amp; 13, 2002</b>, Don got in a discussion
with Daly about per cent, decimals and fractions. Per cent means (how many cents
in a dollar?- 100), per means divided by, so per cent means ÷ 100.&nbsp; Don
asked Daly how many squares on the card? (the &quot;squares&quot; are all
supposed to be the same size). There are 100. Don shaded in 2 rows of 10, or 20
squares. So these 2 rows represent 20% = 20/100 = .20&nbsp; . Don asked him, how
many pieces that size are in the whole cake. He said 5. So that piece&nbsp; of
20 squares is 1/5 of the cake, and 1/5 = 20/100 = .20&nbsp; = 20% . 1 square
would be .01 = 1% = 1/100 of the cake.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalypicprct.gif" width="286" height="293"></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Then Don asked Daly to color in a piece of the
cake. He shaded in the green piece and he said there were 3 1/3 of them in the
whole cake!!! So the name of the green piece is 1/(3 1/3). That was really
exciting to see this! He also said it was
30/100 = .30 = 30%. Then Don showed Daly how he could change 1/(3 1/3) to a
simple fraction- see his work in green below.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/dalypercent.jpg" width="527" height="664"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Daly was involved with the following ideas above:</b><br>
1. complex fractions (a fraction in the fraction)
<br>2. multiplying a whole number by a mixed number
<br>3. changing a % to a fraction and a decimal and they are different
ways of writing the same number
<br>4. Reducing fractions and finding equivalent fractions (=fractions,
multiplying by 1, even if it is the
form of 2/2 or dividing by 1!)</p>
<p align="left">Daly brought up a problem from school, like John had 18 more
coins than Kevin, and together they 86. How many coins did they each have. They
talked about that for a while and he was able to figure it out.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3"> November 20, 2002</font></b> As in last weeks
work, Daly colored in 8 rows on the 10x10 square and found the fraction and
decimal and % name for that, .80= 80/100 = 4/5= 80% = 1/(1 1/4) just to make
sure he had it. then he made up 60%=60/100=.60=15/25=3/5. Daly solved equations
the equations&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">2x + 3 =17 {7}&nbsp;&nbsp; 2x + 3 = 18&nbsp; {7
1/2}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2x + 3 = 19 {8} and 3x + 5 = 18 {4 1/3}</p>
<p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="#FF00FF">Great job Daly; it has been
exciting to work with you!</font></b></p>
<p align="left">Don suggested he then make up some equations for Mom and Dad to
figure out.</p>

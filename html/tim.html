<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>50 year-old M.D. Tim, </b></font><font size="5"><b>enjoys
solving problems in Don's worksheet book</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF00FF"><b>more things are added as they go
on...</b></font></p>
<p align="left">Tim wants to learn calculus to help him understand the
mathematics in &quot;neurophysiology and digital signal processing&quot;- which
involves Fourier series. He had seen one of Don's ads in <font color="#800000"><b><i>Scientific
American</i></b></font> magazine from about 10 years ago. He called on <b> January
30, 2003</b> to order Don's worksheet book and &quot;Changing shapes With
Matrices&quot;. He started work on the worksheet book as soon as he received it.</p>
<p align="left"><b>On Feb. 9</b> Tim sent some work he did form Ch. 1 by fax;
his only mistake was an incorrect scale on his graph of the partials sums from
the infinite series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... but realized it would approach 1&nbsp;
( goes to 1, or -&gt; 1)&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Tim started to get us connected via Yahoo IM. He bought a mike
and a webcam. He could see Don's webcam picture from his website until they
would connect on Yahoo.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">On
<b>Feb. 17 </b></span></font>in a phone conversation <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Tim
they went through the infinite series starting with 1/2-&gt;1 and 1/3 -&gt; 1/2.
He predicted from the pattern that starting with 1/4 -&gt;1/3, and starting with
1/n -&gt; 1/(n-1). They worked on 2/5 + (2/5)^2 + (2/5)^3 + ... and he found
that goes to 2/3 and he generalized that A/B + (A/B)^2 + (A/B)^3 + ... would go
to A/(B-A) . Don also showed Tim how Jeff, a HS student,&nbsp; got the infinite
series ( see Lizzy and Cheryl's page at <a href="/html/lizcheryl.html">http://www.mathman.biz/html/lizcheryl.html</a>
). Tim went through p. 19, changing the decimal 0.343434... to a fraction using
the infinite series for that 34/100 + 34/10000 + 34/1000000 + ... Later in the
day they went over writing a program in on the TI 83 plus, to get the limit of
an infinite series as on p.19. Don left him with 4 things to work on for the
next session</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><font size="3">On
<b>Feb. 22 </b></font>they went over the infinite repeating decimal for 3/9 =
0.3333..., 7/9 = 0.7777... and he could do 37/99 = 0.373737... Tim had started
on ch. 2, the cookie sharing. He found that sharing 5 cookies between 3 people
each person would get 1 2/3 cookies. Then Don gave him the problem of using the
special scissors that only cut into 2 pieces. He got 1 + 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8 + 0/16
+... and he saw that this could be written as a <b>bimal</b> 1.101010... or as a
<b>decimal</b>&nbsp; 1.6666... Then they got into a discussion of what would
happen if they did the same problem sharing 5 cookies between 3 people, but used
scissors that only cut into 7 pieces! He found&nbsp; 1 2/3 = 1.666... (in base
10) = 1.101010... (in base 2) = 1.4444... (in base 7). WOW! [There is something
there that Don hasn't verbalized!]</span></p>

using the scissors that can only cut into two pieces the binary system suddenly
clicked and made sense to me for the first time . I could find the binary

Don gave Tim 2 linear graphs for which he was to find the equations; Tim did
this easily. They talked about the guess my rules on p88. Tim was stuck on #3
{(0,0), (1,1), (2,3), (4,6)..} They looked at the differences and the second
differences.
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Then
they worked on graphing y = x<sup>2</sup> looking at the pattern (tan color on
graph- from (0,0) over 1, up 1, over 1 up 3, over&nbsp; up 5- these are odd
numbers and 1+3+5 = 9 = 3<sup>2</sup> ), then moving the parabola up 2 units
(red); then move to the right (blue)- Tim got y = x<sup>2</sup> - 2&nbsp; at
first, but realized that moves the original parabola down 2. Then he came up
with the equation y = (x-2)<sup>2</sup> .

then had 4 things to do for next time- turn the original parabola upside down,
find the rule for p88 #3,&nbsp; move the parabola right 2, up 3, and rotate the
parabola 90<sup>o</sup> CW.<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>
March 8: </b>Tim looked at the differences in functions. On p.88 #3&nbsp; the
rule was&nbsp; x(x+1)/2 = y or (1/2)x<sup>2</sup> + (1/2)x = y. The second
differences are constant and = 1. In x<sup>2</sup> = y the second differences
are constant and = 2. Tim correctly predicted that for the function 2x<sup>2</sup>
+ 3 = y, the second differences are constant and = 4.<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>
March 10:</b> Tim got the rule for the shuttle puzzle and the tower puzzle, also
in chapter 6. Don had him do powers of 2 with negative exponents.<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>
March 17: </b>In graphing<b>&nbsp;</b> x(x+1)/2 = y or (1/2)x<sup>2</sup> + (1/2)x =
y from March 8, Don and Tim realized that the pattern in the parabola was the
same as in x<sup>2</sup>
 = y&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/drtimshine/parabpattern31703.jpg" width="382" height="337"><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">except
it would go over 1, up 1/2 of 1, over 1 up 1/2 of 3... They found the vertex,
with the x-coordinate 1/2 way between <sup>-</sup>1 and 0 or <sup>-</sup>1/2,
then put this in the equation to find the y-coordinate of <sup>-</sup>1/4.<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>
March 24:</b> Don worked with Tim on using Derive to solve equations, finding
the limit of the series 2/5 + (2/5)^2 + (2/5)^3 + ..., and expanding (x+y)^2.<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>
March 31, '03: </b>Don started Tim on trigonometry as done on his page <a href="/html/trig.html">http://www.mathman.biz/html/trig.html</a>
. They went over Tim's work on the SA/Vol problem on p. 122 #6. Don showed Tim
using the webcam, how to find the growth of the nautilus shell on p. 104 in Ch.
6. Tim came up with the average of 3 ratios of the radius vectors every 360<sup>o</sup>
to be 3.24 (very very close to Land's 3.2) and he came up with the 3 measures of
the angle between the tangent and the radius vectors to be 80.16<sup>o</sup>
(very very close to Land's 79.5<sup>o</sup>)!!<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto" align="left">On<b>

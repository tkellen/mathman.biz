<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Ian, a 4th grader, adds sine waves at right angles to make a
bowtie</font></b></p>

<p align="left">Ian has worked on graphing sine waves for about two months. See
Don's <a href="/html/trig.html">beginning Trig</a>
to see how this can be done. He made a sine wave, then made one twice the
amplitude (twice as tall), one twice the frequency (2 waves in 360<sup>o</sup>)
and moved the sine wave to the right and left (phase changes). After doing these
on graph paper by hand, he used <i>Derive</i> to make these changes on the
computer.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;At one point Don showed Ian the output of an oscillator on
an oscilloscope screen. (see <a href="../images/jonspic.jpg">Jonathan at the
oscillator and oscilloscope</a>).&nbsp; Ian played with changing the frequency of the
oscillator, then both the frequencies of the oscillator as well as on the
oscilloscope.&nbsp; <img align="middle" src="../images/bowtieonscope.gif" width="169" height="159">Ian saw a bowtie (among other
things) on the oscilloscope screen, made by the two waves at
right angles, where one wave is twice the frequency of the other.&nbsp;Don showed Ian how to add&nbsp; y = sin (2<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">q)</span>
and<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">
</span>x = sin<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">q</span>
on graph paper. Don didn't do a good job at first, because Ian got confused and
he plotted points that were not supposed to be there. Then Don worked with Ian
again and he got it all worked out. It took at lot of patience and persistence on his part.
His results are shown below. <font color="#FF00FF" size="4"><b>Fine
job, Ian!</b></font></p>

<p align="left">Don took Ian's graph and used it to show how the bowtie came
about from the 2 sine waves, below. There was a blank space in the upper left hand
corner square of the graph paper (an 8x8 square). The equation&nbsp; y = sin (2<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">q)
</span>
was graphed starting at the right side of this square, going
to the right. On both graphs the scale was from <sup>-</sup>1 to 1 with .25 for each
little square. The equation of x = sin<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">q
</span>was graphed starting at the bottom of the square, going down The scale
for <span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial">q
</span>was each square was 15'. Don picked only 4 points (x's) on the bowtie at&nbsp; <b><font color="#0000FF">1</font></b>,
<font color="#0000FF"><b>2</b></font>, <font color="#0000FF"><b>3</b> </font>and

<b><font color="#FF0000">30'</font></b> , <font color="#00FF00"><b>45'</b></font>,
and <b><font color="#008000">90'</font></b> on the two graphs. He started on
the <b> y = sin (2</b><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial"><b>q)</b>
</span>
graph at <b><font color="#FF6600">0'</font></b>, and drew a line to the <b>left</b>.
Then he started on the <b> x = sin</b><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial"><b>q</b>
</span>at <b><font color="#FF6600">0'</font></b> and went <b>up</b> until it
met the

To get point #<font color="#0000FF"><b>2</b></font>, he started <b> on the y = sin (2</b><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial"><b>q)</b>

the dotted line </b></font> to the<b><font color="#FF0000"> </font> </b>graph), then draw a line to the
<b>left</b>. Then he started <b> on the x = sin</b><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial"><b>q</b>

</span>at <b><font color="#FF0000">30' </font></b>( <b><font color="#FF0000">the dotted line
to the right </font> </b>to the graph) and draw a line <b>up </b>to where it
meets the other <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font> line; these 2 <b><font color="#FF0000">lines</font><font color="#FF6600"> </font></b>meet at point
<font color="#0000FF"><b>2</b></font>,<b><font color="#0000FF">
</font></b>the<b><font color="#0000FF"> </font><font color="#FF0000">x</font></b>.
Don shows how to get the x's at points <font color="#0000FF"><b>3</b> </font>and
<font color="#0000FF"><b>4 </b></font>by
<font color="#0000FF"><b> </b></font>continuing along each curve to <b><font color="#00FF00">45'</font></b>,
and <b><font color="#008000">90'</font></b>, again going to the <b>left</b> and
<b>up</b> each time. This is how Ian did the rest, every 15', to obtain the
bowtie.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/iansbowtie2.jpg" width="539" height="519"></p>

<p align="left">Then Don got out the compound sand pendulum with sand in a
catsup bottle, drawn here by Sheri. It is really two pendulums made with a
double length of string, one from the floor to the top of the Y where it is
attached by tacks to perpendicular walls (and the two lengths are adjustable by
means of 2 knots -not shown here). The other pendulum is from the floor to the
middle of the Y, also adjustable, by an alligator clip.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sherisp.jpg" width="180" height="243"></p>

<p align="left">The compound pendulum acts like the oscillator and oscilloscope
where one can change the frequencies, by changing the lengths of the pendulums.
With the compound sand pendulum Ian created a pretzel, like that below:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/pretzel.gif" width="321" height="216"></p>

<p align="left">Don showed Ian that if one went across the figure it would
intersect the pretzel 4 places (ideally), and if one went down, it would
intersect the pretzel in 3 places. So the ratio of the frequencies of the two
pendulums is 4:3. (There is a relationship between the lengths of the pendulums
and the frequencies of the waves produced, which they did not explore at this
time).&nbsp;</p>

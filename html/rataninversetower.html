from one peg to another. The rules are: you can't put a bigger disc on top of a 
smaller one, you can only move one disc at a time, and later you will need to 
move the discs in the <b>minimum # of moves. The table and graph show the # of 
discs vs the minimum # of moves</b>.</font></p>

The function that we found for the tower puzzle rule was 2<b><sup>x</sup></b> - 1 = y.&nbsp; 
We 
found the the graph of the inverse by switching the x and y-coordinates. So the 
point 
(2,3) on the original graph (black), will go to (3,2) on the orange graph- the 
inverse-whose equation was </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2<b><sup>y</sup></b> <font size="4"><b>-</b></font> 1 = x<br>Notice also that 
the&nbsp; y=x line is the line of symmetry of the 2 graphs. [Don noticed on 
Ratan's graph that between 0 and 1 the orange graph shows up, but the black does 
not, and is covered by the blue-it got unnoticed by both of us.].<br>So to solve for 
y we first had to figure <font face="Arial" size="4"><b> <a href="http://www.mathman.biz/html/logarithms.html">
<font color="#FF3300">how to use logs,</font></a></b></font> because y was an exponent. We first 
figured out that&nbsp; that 
the log2<sup><b>3</b></sup> = 3*log2 which we then found out equals the log of 8. This means that 
the identity is log A<sup>B</sup> equals B*log A. Then we combined this with our 
skills of simplifying equations to solve the problem. So we tried to find an 
equation with y in terms of x&nbsp;&nbsp; But then we realized a problem with 
the equation it was solving for x instead of y. So we the following: <br><br><b>
<font size="4" face="Arial">Work (simplified equation)</font></b><br><br>2<sup>y</sup> 
- 1 = x</p>
<p align="left">Add 1 to both sides of the equation to get<br>2<sup><font size="4">y</font></sup> 
= x + 1</p>
<p align="left">Then take the log of both sides, to get</p>
<p align="left">log 2<sup><font size="4">y</font></sup> = log (x+1)</p>
<p align="left">Using the identity above, the log 2<sup><font size="4">y</font></sup>= 
y* log2</p>
<p align="left">So&nbsp; y* log 2 = log (x+1),</p>
<p align="left"><br>So we get the equation of the inverse, </p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="5" face="Arial" color="#FF3300">y = log(x+1)/log2</font></b> </p>
<p align="left">[Ratan made a second mistake when he wrote to Don and said there 
was a second equation for the inverse. He had 2y=x+1,&nbsp; (2y instead of 2<sup>y</sup>) 
then divided both sides by 2 and got y=.5x+.5 which is a linear equation and 
couldn't be right. Don wrote an email to Ratan about this error].</p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">To check our work, if we put 3 in 
for x, we should get 2 for y </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">then<font color="#FF3300"> y = 
log(3+1)/log2</font>= <font color="#FF3300">log(4)/log2 = .602/.301= 2</font> it 
works!</font></b></p>

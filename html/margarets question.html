<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Margaret, an 8th grader, asks a fine
question!</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Margaret graphed 2 linear equations in 2
variables and found where the lines intersected. Out of nowhere she asked,
&quot;Why do we always solve the equations for y, like y = 4x + 2 and y = x + 2
&quot;</font><font size="3">. Margaret knew the slope of each line was the
coefficient of x (4 for the first line and 1 for the second line), and the
y-intercept was the adding number ( 2 in each case below).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/margarets2graphs.jpg" width="269" height="307"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Don suggested they solve each equation for x.
Margaret and Don worked on this and they came up with x = (1/4)y - 1/2 for the
first equation and x = y - 2 for the second equations. N.B. these equations are
equivalent to the original ones, and the graphs are the same. How are these
equations different from the original equations? The slope of the new first one
is the coefficient of y, 1/4, or the <b>reciprocal</b> of the original slope of
4). The adding number on the new first one is -1/2, which is the <b>x-intercept</b>!!
For y=x+2 the slope is 1 and the adding number is the y-intercept 2. When one
solves for x, one get x=y-2, the new slope is still <b>1</b>, (the reciprocal of
1 is 1), and the adding number is -2, which is the <b>x-intercept</b>!!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Now Don had never seen this before; it was very
exciting to learn something new.</font></p>

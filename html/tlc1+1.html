<p align="left">Don asked &quot;What's 1 plus 1?&quot;. Tessa said
&quot;2&quot;. Don asked &quot;What's 1 ten plus 1 ten?&quot;. Tessa answered
&quot;twenty&quot;. Don said &quot;Yes, 2 tens&quot;. And then they continued
like that. After this <font color="#FF00FF"><b>5-minute math session</b></font>,
most of her aunts and uncles gave her problems like these and she could do them
correctly. In fact, she did verbally, 1/7 + 1/7 = 2/7, 1 tangent x + 1 tangent x
= 2 tangent x, and 1 negative + 1 negative = 2 negative. She also kept giving
other people problems like these!</p>
<p align="left">The next day July 22, 2001, Don asked Tessa &quot;What is 1x<sup>2
</sup>+ 1x<sup>2 </sup>= ?&quot;, Tessa said &quot;2x<sup>2 </sup>&quot;. Then
she said &quot;Oh Grandpa, give me harder ones!&quot; Don gave her 2 tangent x -
1 tangent x. She wasn't sure about the subtraction, so Don just showed her 2
fingers and took away 1 finger, saying 2 take away 1 = 1. So Tessa could do 2
tangent x - 1 tangent x = 1 tangent x.</p>
<p align="left">Notice Tessa writes her 2's and 5's backwards and Don never said
anything to her! Her Mom said she had done 10 + 10 = 20 recently.</p>
<p align="left">Why does Don think this is an important lesson? For one thing,
the kids really get excited about handling large numbers quickly. Two, there is
a pattern to these that they understand. And 3, this is algebra they are doing,
not just arithmetic- because 1 of anything + 1 of the same thing is always 2 of
the same thing or as they say in algebra: 1x + 1x = 2x.</p>
<p align="left">Don had Terri, Tessa's Mom, put the 3D Multiplication Tables
together (see the <a href="3Dmultables.html">stack</a>). Then Terri worked with
Tessa on it. Here are some <a href="/html/tlc3D.html">pictures</a>
of this.</p>

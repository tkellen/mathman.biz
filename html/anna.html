<title>Anna: the sum of the angles of a triangle is not always 180 degrees!</title>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Anna, a 5th grader:
&quot;The sum of the angles of a triangle is not always 180<sup><sup>o </sup></sup>!&quot;</b></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Mr. Cohen told me that the number of degrees
in a full turn or circle, is 360�. Then he asked me if I knew about the sum of
the three angles in a triangle. I said no, so he told me: the sum of the three
angles of a triangle are all the angles added together. He drew a triangle and
gave me a <b>rotagram</b> to add the angles together. He gave me a quick lesson
on how to add the angles with the rotagram. (The rotagram is made of 2 pieces of
clear plastic- a square with a black line and cut in 4 places to hold the
circular piece, which has a green line. When you put the 2 pieces together, you
rotate the circular piece to get the angle on the rotagram equal to the angle on
the paper).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/anatri3.jpg" width="394" height="153"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">After I added the angles of the triangle, I
told him they added up to 180� (1/2 of a circle).&nbsp; He said the that the
sum of the angles of any triangle is always 180�.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">I did not believe him because I wondered what
if one triangle is very, very huge and another triangle is very, very tiny? How
can three angles so huge or three angles so small add up to 180�?</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/anatr5.jpg" width="460" height="223"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">So I drew very small triangles&nbsp; and a
huge one on the floor, on butcher paper. The angles all added up to 180�. Mr.
Cohen thought it was good that I was questioning how this could always be true.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Mr. Cohen showed me a triangle on a globe and
said its angles are 90�,&nbsp; 90� and 15�, which add up to <b>195�</b>,
because it's on a sphere and the sides are curved.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/anatr6.jpg" width="436" height="140"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">He also showed me page 128 in the book
&quot;Mathematics, The Science of Patterns&quot; by Keith Devlin, a Scientific
American Library book. There was the picture of a pseudosphere and on that the
angle sum of a triangle&nbsp; is less than 180�.</font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="5">He told me I was right: <font color="#FF0000">not
</font>all triangles equal 180�.</font></b></p>

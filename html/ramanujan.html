Ramanajan's Nest of Square Roots Giving a Number<br>

<br>

Don read the biography of Ramanujan: "The Man Who Knew Infinity- A Life
of the Genius Ramanujan" by Robert Kanigel, years ago, but never
studied his works until he saw the 3 books in the following series
during the summer of 2011. The mother of one of Don's students let him
borrow 2 of the books, the Primary School and the Middle School. He
started working on some of Ramanujan's problems.<br>

Don got interested in the Nest of Square Roots Giving a Number. He also
started showing what he did to some of his students. Don made his first
one below:<br>

&nbsp;
<br>

Don was intrigued by all the patterns above.<br>

<br>

Don worked with Shouri, a 3rd grader, the following week he came up
with this nest:<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 898px; height: 1098px;" alt="" src="../images/ramanshouri49.jpg"><br>
</div>

Don never saw one like Shouri did here- he repeated the 6*7 !&nbsp; Shouri
also tried breaking 49 into 8+41 above, but evidently he realized 41 was
prime and went no further.<p align="center">Shouri also came up with the 
generalzation:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Don had Grant send 
	an email to Prof. Bruce Berndt at the U of Illinois math department, who has 
	written books about Ramanujan's notebooks. He encouraged Grant to find other 
	generalizations using the nested square roots.</font></div>

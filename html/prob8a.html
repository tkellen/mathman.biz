<br><b>Chapter 8</b>: Solving Equations and Iteration.<font 
color=#FF0000> Don's 
videotape #2 shows a 6 and 7 year old working on iterating 
functions.</font><hr><b>The idea of 
iteration for me, started with trying to solve a quadratic equation 
10 different ways! In the process I got into <font color=#0000FF>continued 
fractions, infinite continued fractions, and iteration</font>- it has been a 
very 
exciting area of mathematics with applications to population increase, 
finding the square root of a number, and extends to the field of chaos 
theory and fractals!
And my students find it interesting, which is the most important 
thing.</b>
<p>For my younger students I usually start with a rule or function 
like 
2<b>x</b>. We put a number in for <b>x</b>, get the number out, then put 
that output in for <b>x</b>, and continue that process. We get an 
<b>infinite sequence</b> of numbers. In this case the sequence diverges, 
doesn't go to a number. For example if we put 3-><b>x</b>, we get 6. We 
then put 6-><b>x</b> and we get 12. <br>We get the infinite sequence 3, 6, 
12, 24, ...<br>Later on, with older students, it is not a big step 
to use 1.1<b>x</b> as the function and show this is the same problem as 
increasing the population of a town 10% each year. A very important 
application. <p>A teacher in one of Don's workshops, 
made up this function:<img 
align=middle src="../images/5x2a.gif" width="52" height="26">. We'll pick a number, say 0, 
and put it in for x. What do we get out? 5 + 0/2 = 5. Then we put 5 in 
for x. What do we get out this time? 5 + 5/2 = 7.5 Now let's keep track 
of the infinite sequence we get: 0, 5, 7.5, 8.75, ... The question is 
what's happening? Does this sequence converge? <b>I ask my students to 
do the first 8 or so by hand, to make sure they can divide and write the 
answer as a fraction or mixed number and a decimal</b>. Only then 
will I let them use a calulator to do more. Then I'll get 
them to 
the computer to use <I>Mathematica</I> to do 200 iterations and let it 
carry the answer to 100 decimal places! <br>
Finish the graph of this sequence, the beginning of which is shown 
below:<center><br>
<img src="../images/gr5x2a.gif" width="290" height="285"></center><br>Start with a new number, 
like 100 and see what happens.<br>Start with -17 and see what happens. 
Graph these sequences on the same graph paper. Is there a pattern?<br> 
Each infinite sequence has a limit of 10 for <img align=middle 
src="../images/5x2a.gif" width="52" height="26">. Look at the numbers there. What do you 
think would happen if we started with 6 + x/2 ? a + x/2 ?<br>What 
would happen with 5 + x/3 ? 5 + x/4 ?<p> Another interesting function I 
do with my younger students is 6/x. Interesting things happen with this 
one!<p>

 <font size=5><font color=#FF0000>11 ways to solve a quadratic 
equation</font><br><font size=3> <b>Method 1. </b>By guessing and the sum 
and product of the roots (see above)<br>
<b>Method 2.</b> Solving x<sup><font size=-1>2</font></sup> - 5x + 6 = 0 for 
x to get x = <img align=middle src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28">.<br> Jonathan, at 
age 7, solved this quadratic equation like this: <br>
<center><img src="../images/jons56x.gif" width="355" height="183"></center><br><b>2a.</b><a 
href="infcf.html">We can get an infinite continued fraction and 
find approximations of the roots of the equation</a>
<br><b>2b.</b><a
href="it56x.html">We'll iterate the function <img align=middle 
src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28">starting with different numbers, then graph 
these sequences.</a><br><b>2c.</b><a
href="g356x.html">Graph 3 successive 'pieces' of the infinite 
continued fraction</a><br><b>2d.</b><a
href="g56x.html">Graph y = <img align=middle 
src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28">, then connect points whose coordinates are 
consecutive input numbers</a>
<br><b>Methods 3., 4., and 5.</b> You solve x<sup><font 
size=-1>2</font></sup> - 5x + 6 = 0 
for x, but in a different way than Jonathan did, (but not one of methods 
6-11 below), and do the corresponding 
things as in <b>2a., 2b., 2c. and 2d</b> above. You might find more than 
3 other ways! Please let me know if you do.<br> <b>Method 6.</b> Solving 
x<sup><font size=-1>2</font></sup> 
- x - 1 = 0 using a calculator to hone in on the two solutions.<br>
<b>Method 7.</b> By factoring (one of the 'normal' ways)<br>
<b>Method 8.</b> By completing the square<br>
<b>Method 9.</b> Using the quadratic formula<br>
<b>Method 10.</b> Graph  x<sup><font size=-1>2</font></sup> - 5x + 6 =
y (where it crosses the x-axis will be the roots, if they are real)<br>
<b>Method 11.</b> Spiraling in to the intersection of 2 curves<br>
<font color=#ff0000>Flash! This just happened (10/26/96): Colleen, a 7th 
grader, solved 
x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> - x - 1 = 0 and got<br> x = x<sup><font
size=-2>2</font></sup> - 1. Try iterating this. It's exciting when 
something unexpected happens! That's what makes my teaching interesting 
and enjoyable. I've spent the last 2 hours working on this in 
<I>Mathematica.</I><hr>

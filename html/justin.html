Shapes With Matrices&quot;</a>)</font></p>
<p>Justin worked on different transformations with matrices. He found the following 2x2 matrix <img align="middle" src="../images/matrixreflect1.gif" width="60" height="48" >

<font size="3"> that would take the <font color="#0000FF"><b> original dog (blue)</b></font> into its
<font color="#FF0000"><b>image</b></font>, the mirror being </font>the vertical y-axis. </p>

<p align="left">The big breakthrough came when Justin asked &quot;What matrix
would reflect the dog, if the mirror (the <font color="#FF00FF"><b>purple</b></font>
line) was at x=3.5??&quot; !!! Don had never done this before, so this was very
exciting- he was going to learn something new.</p>

<p align="left">Justin and Don worked on this separately and together. Don
looked at the x coordinates and found that&nbsp; Newx = 7- Oldx or&nbsp; 2*3.5 -
Oldx . They both realized that the Newy=Oldy. Then it was a matter of
multiplying x by something to get 7-x. They figured this out to be 7/x - 1
or&nbsp; 2*3.5/x&nbsp; - 1. This was the number that goes in the first row and
first column of the transformation matrix. The final result was:</p>

<p align="center">Justin checked various vertical lines of symmetry and
generalizing, where the mirror or line of symmetry is at x=a, wrote:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/matrixreflec2gen.gif" width="241" height="93"></p>
<p align="left">Justin then decided to do reflections with a horizontal line of
symmetry at y=a.. He knew the 2x2 transformation matrix that reflects the dog in the x-axis
is&nbsp; <img align="middle" src="../images/matrixreflecthor.gif" himself he came up with:</p Working width="73" height="48">Then
he found the 2x2 transformation matrix that reflects the dog in the mirror or line of symmetry
at x=a is:

<p align="left">Justin then decided to do a reflection in the line y=x ! He's
working on this.</p>

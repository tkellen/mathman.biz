<p align="left"><font size="3"><b><font color="#008000">Don had Sara do some
division problems the week before her work below. One he gave her was 10 divided
by 3,&nbsp; which Don, as usual, talked about sharing 10 cookies between 3
people, using 3x5&quot; cards for cookies (see sample problems from </font><font color="#000000">chapter
2</font><font color="#008000"> his worksheet book at <a href="http://www.mathman.biz/html/chapters.html">www.mathman.biz/html/prob2.html</a>
). Sara said each person got 3 cookies with 1 left over. She cut the 1
leftover-cookie into 3 pieces, each 1/3 of the cookie- see the diagram below. So
each person received 3+ 1/3 cookies. He also showed her other ways to write a
division problem. And Sara had to figure out that when one cuts a cookie into 3
pieces, each piece is 1/3 of the cookie, a key idea! She tried the same problem on a calculator and got
3.3333... Instead of trying to show her how decimals work, Don had the idea of
seeing what would happen if she did 10/1, 10/2, 10/3, 10/4, 10/5, 10/6, 10/7,
10/8, 10/9, and 10/10. Don wasn't sure what would happen, but he was almost sure
there would be a PATTERN!&nbsp;</font></b></font></p>

shows the power of PATTERNS in mathematics! It also shows Don's willingness to
try new things, his fearlessness, and his being excited about the unknown and
what will happen. Normally Don aims for students finding different ways to solve
a problem; for example, if one shares 10 cookies between 3 people, a student
might share 3 each, then cut the left-over cookie into 4 pieces, each getting
1/4, then cutting the left-over 1/4 into 3 pieces, each 1/12, so each person
would get 3 + 1/4 + 1/12 (which is equivalent to 3+1/3 which Sara ended up with
above). OR students, sharing when they can, then cut left-over pieces into 2
equal pieces every time, and end up with an infinite series 3 + 0/2 + 1/4 + 0/8 +
1/16 + 0/32 + ... which&nbsp; is also equal to 3 1/3!&nbsp;</b></font></span></p>

that Maya worked on The Peg Game and The Tower Puzzle (ch.6) before the
division. Maya knew how to do these divisions by cookie-sharing also.&nbsp; Don
left 9/6 = 1 3/6 without reducing the 3/6, in order to continue the pattern. </font></span><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"> Too
much emphasis is placed on reducing fractions to lowest terms, because you also lose

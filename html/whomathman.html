The name 'Mathman' for Don came when he visited the home of a 2nd grader. Upon
reaching the front door, he heard his student inside the house say, &quot;Mom,
here comes the mathman!&quot; Then Don's wife Marilyn ordered a license plate
for their car: MATHMAN. For those of you who remember 'The Lone Ranger' (the
Masked man), at
Don's 50th birthday party, one of his friends gave him a tee-shirt which had
printed on the back 'Who was that Mathman?'<br>
<br>
Don Cohen was born in Jersey City, N.J. in 1930. He has taught all ages of students for
56+ years, the last 34 of those as co-founder and teacher of&nbsp; The Math
Program, with his partner Jerry Glynn.<br>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">After 7 years of teaching in a junior high school, he realized there must be
a more enjoyable and effective way to teach math. He searched for alternatives.
This lead to designing new curriculum for NY State; learning about mathematics
and creativity from Robert B. Davis (who died in Dec. '97) with The Madison Project;
learning what real teaching is about by observing great teachers such as Sue
Monell at Bank Street; teaching teachers; working on PLATO (a computer-based
education system started at the U of IL); all before Don and Jerry invented The
Math Program. This is a great organizational scheme which enables them to work
with about 5 students at a time, in their homes, with students of all abilities
and ages (3 to 73) and have time to write, learn, and work together.</font></p>

One of the most interesting and satisfying events (besides the birth of his sons,
grandchildren, and greatgrandchildren) in Don's life, was the completion of his book<br>
</font>
<center><b><font face="Arial">Calculus By and For Young People<br>
(ages 7, yes 7 and up)</font></center><font face="Arial"><br>
</font>
</b><font face="Arial">which was reviewed in the Dec. 1988 issue of <i>Scientific American</i>, as
well as in many other places.<font color="#000000"> He then, with his son Brian
in IA, produced his two videotapes</font>. In 1992 Don created his book <u>Calculus
By and For Young People-Worksheets</u>, which was an attempt to help young people, parents and teachers, by asking
questions leading to the different ideas in his book. He then he produced &quot;A Map to
Calculus&quot;. The third book Don wrote was &quot;<u>Changing Shapes With Matrices</u>&quot;. He 
has also worked with students around the country and around the world (as far as
Tasmania, AU), in his&nbsp; Math By Mail/Email Program. Students also have come to Champaign
for a week at a time from around the 
country and the world to work with Don (from as far away as Japan). In 1996 Don 
started his web site, helped by Jenny, then a sophomore at MIT who
Don had as a student in The Math Program when she was in 5th grade! Don's former
internet server was part-owned by a former 5th grade student. His <u>A Map to
Calculus</u> was made clickable by another former student, Jonathan Storm. Don's 3 books
were published in Japanese as well.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>The 1986 THE FRIEND OF CHILDREN AWARD was presented to
Don by The Montessori School of C-U and The East Central Illinois Association
for the Education of Young Children.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>In 2008, Don was the recipient of an Excellence in
Education Award, given by his alumni association at SUNY at Albany.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Don was asked to give an online presentation for
Math2.0, a Google Math group, on August 4, 2010</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Don 's presentation <u>Calculus By and For Young
People, ages 7 and up</u> was accepted by the 2010 Global Education Conference
and given on November 16, online.</b></font></p>
<p>Don had 3 students, a long time ago, <b>who now bring their children</b> to
work with Don- it doesn't get better than that!<font face="Arial"> <br>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Don has been blessed with a wonderful wife (of 58+ years), three fine sons, 6 terrific grandchildren and
<b><font size="3">3 greatgrandchildren</font></b>! He is a
watercolor artist (see the shell on his main page) and as a friend said, &quot;he takes time to
smell the flowers and gives them to people&quot;. See his page <b><a href="tlc&amp;grpaint.html">Don
paints in watercolor</a> </b>with.. students and grandchildren</font></p>

Don with Khaki (on the cover of his worksheet book), then age 17, a long time
ago, used the computer program <i>Derive</i> to
&quot;zoom in&quot; on a curve to find the slope of the tangent at a point on
the curve, leading to the derivative. She was preparing for her Fall calculus
class. (see Ch. 14). Khaki is now a teacher and using this book with her
students!

<br><b>Chapter 10</b>: Pi and Square Roots<hr>
<b>1. Kohler follows Archimedes</b><br>Kohler, a 5th grader at the time, 
started with  a 12-dot circle. He 
drew the circle, a diameter, and inscribed an equilateral triangle in it. 
He measured the 
diameter of the circle and perimeter of the triangle in mm. He then found 
the ratio of p/d. You try it.

Notice, Kohler got 2 R50 and we had a big dicussion about leaving the answer as 
a fraction and decimal, finally.  He then did the same thing for 
a regular hexagon,
and regular dodecagon. You try it. What if you keep going,
what's happens to this ratio p/d?<br>Write a program to get the 
ratios of 
the perimeter of polygons of 3x2<sup><font size=-2>n</font></sup> sides to the diameter (d) of the circle.<br>

<b>2. The Gregory-Leibnitz series</b><br>
<b>3. From Wells..</b>

<br><b>4. Iterating the sqrt of a number.</b> One day a 7th grader, in a 
moment of just playing with a calculator, put in a number, then hit the 
square root key again and again. Try that. 
Graph the numbers you get vs. the number of iterations. What 
do you notice? Try a different number. Write a program to do this.<br>
<b>5. Finding the square root of 2 by squaring numbers on a 
calculator.</b><br>

<b>6. 
Finding <sup><img align=middle src="../images/sqrt40.gif" width="27" height="18"></sup>by 
'iteration of the average' method.</b><br>What does <sup><img align=middle 
src="../images/sqrt40.gif" width="27" height="18"></sup> mean? We're looking for a number such that 
when you multiply it by itself you get 40 or <sup> <img align=middle 
src="../images/bxb40.gif" width="91" height="22"></sup>. Suppose we guess 5. 40/5 = 8. 8x5=40, but 
the two factors have to be the same. 8 is too big 
and 5 is too small. If we find their average, we'll be closer to the  
<sup><img align=middle src="../images/sqrt40.gif" width="27" height="18"></sup>. So we'll do 
this<img 
align=middle src="../images/g5.gif" width="60" height="44">= 6.5. Then we'll take 6.5 and find 
the average of this and 40/6.5, like this <img
align=middle src="../images/g65.gif" width="56" height="40">. Notice we have an iteration 
problem now where <b>G</b> is the guess number <img 
align=middle src="../images/itav40.gif" width="61" height="46"> -> 
<b>G</b>! Here's a number line picture of these first 2 iterations:<br>
<center><img src="../images/itavpic.gif" width="402" height="168"></center><br>
So we get an infinite sequence 5, 6.5, 6.326923077, 6.324555763, 
6.324555320, ... After only 4 iterations we get the <sup> <img align=middle 
src="../images/sqrt40.gif" width="27" height="18"></sup>correct to 9 decimal places. This 
method gives a rapidly converging sequence to find the square root of a 
number. <br>Write a program to do this iteration.

 A black belt in Tai Kwando before graduating from Uni HS, Lian spent his next
year in The Americorps as a volunteer. He received an award from the Arizona
Council on Aging for helping American Indian Elders remain in their homes as
members of their communities and as keepers of their traditions. During that
year he also worked evenings and weekends with &quot;Stand Up For Kids&quot;, a
group helping street kids. He spent many hours talking with young people who
lived on the streets of San Diego and saw that they got food and clothing.

<b>Extractions</b>: The Community Caretaker Awards are designed to recognize 
individuals who create unique opportunities for their communities through their 
own hard work and service. Some of the attributes that are expected of an award 
winner are strong personal values, drive and an entrepreneurial spirit, 
according to a press release. The program has donated more than $150,000 to 
communities throughout the United States and Canada since 1993. Alan's award 
money will go to Standup for Kids, a nonprofit organization that serves to 
support and motivate homeless and at-risk youth toward lifelong, personal growth 
through an on-the-streets outreach program. He said he received the award mainly 
based on his merits and devotion to Standup for Kids and his ongoing commitment.

<br><b>Chapter 14</b>: Slopes and The Derivative<hr>

slopes.</b><br> <center><img

<b>3.Alec's slopes of mountains and stairs.</b></b>
Use a topographic map to find the slope of your area of the country or 
the slope of a mountain and the slope of a ramp or the 
slope of the steps in your house.<br><b>4. Stories from graphs.</b>
<br><b>5. Estimating slopes:</b><br><center><img

 program <I>Derive</I> to zoom in on a curve at a point, then find the 
slope of the tangent at that point.</b><img align=right
src="../images/zoomx2.gif" width="201" height="652"> <br> When you zoom 
in at the point, 
the curve approaches a straight line! Increase the number grid points so 
you can find the slope more easily. 
<p><p> On the right, going down, we zoom in on the curve <b> y = x<sup><font 
size=-2>2</font></sup> </b> at the point (1,1). <pre>





</pre>
The second graph shows 
the 
same curve, again centered at (1,1), but the scale is X: 0.2, Y: 0.2 
.<pre>




</pre>  
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>  
<pre><font size="3">The third graph ends up 0.02 of a unit apart. Notice what happens. In this small portion </font></pre>  
<pre><font size="3">of the graph, the curve looks like a straight line. The slope of this line is essentially </font></pre>  
<pre><font size="3">the slope of the curve or the <font color="#FF0000">slope of the tangent</font> to the curve at the point (1,1). </font></pre>  
<pre><font size="3">Using the dots on the screen, we can find the slope of this line, which is 2. </font></pre>  
<pre><font size="3">The <font color="#FF0000">slope of the tangent</font> to the curve </font><b><font size="3">y = x</font><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><sup><font 
size=-2> </font></sup><font size="-2"><sup>  </sup></font></b><font size="3">at (1,1) is 2.</font></pre>  
<p align="center">
Zoom in on other points like (2,4) and (3,9), and make a table like 
this:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
x-coordinate  &nbsp &nbsp slope of tangent<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp   1  &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp   
&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp 
&nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp   2<br>&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp 2 &nbsp &nbsp   
&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp
&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp
&nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp;<br>  &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp 3 &nbsp &nbsp  
 &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp
&nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp
&nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp;<p>Find a rule for these pairs of numbers. Whatever you
get will be the <font color="#FF0000"><b>derivative</b></font> of <b><font size="3"> x</font><font size="2"><sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;<sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></font></b><br><pre>

<img align=right

x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 25 at the point (3,4).</font><pre>




















</pre>Look at the third 
graph on the right. What's the slope of this 'line'? It looks like -3/4. 
The point was (3,4). What do you notice?<p><P> What would you predict 
would be 
the slope of the tangent to the circle at the point (4,3)? at (0,5)? 
Wow!<pre>&nbsp;</pre><b><font size="4">Suppose you don't 
have a computer to "zoom in" on the curve </font><font size="3"> x</font><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><font size="4">, can you do this?</font></b><font

Zoom in on other points like (1,2) and (2,4), and some others, and make a 
table like this:<br>x-coordinate  &nbsp &nbsp slope of tangent<br>

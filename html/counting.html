<a href="/html/prob7.html">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p align="left">Counting squares on a <a href="/html/geoboard.html">geoboard</a>

<p align="left">Counting squares under a curve which leads to the integral. See <a href="/html/prob13.html">chapter

work).</p>
<p align="left">Counting up, in looking at the differences in the output of a
function (guess my rule- <a href="/html/prob6.html">chapter
6</a>). Also see <a href="/html/sheri.html">Sheri</a>'s
work (#<b><font size="4">25</font></b>).</p>

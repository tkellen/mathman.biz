studying with Don, summer '99</font></b></p>
<font face="Arial" size="3"><br>
I decided to organize what Katie did with me, by topic, rather than by day. So
these ideas flowed from one day to the next. I don't show all of Katie's
mistakes here; there were some, but not too many. She was very good at
findingpatterns in everything she did.</font>

ideas about: is .999... =1 ?</b></font></p>
After our looking at 1/2+1/4+1/8+...and generalizing A/B +(A/B)^2 + (A/B)^3 +...
-&gt; A/(B-A) and lim as n-&gt; inf of (1+1/n)^n = e Katie had this to say:
<p>&quot;I argue that .999... , if it were to go to infinity, could never equal
1. It could get as close as we wanted, but could always be closer. Mr. Cohen
argues that for all intents and purposes we think of it as 1. He asks me what
fraction&nbsp; .333... is. I say 1/3. Then I realize that saying .333... = 1/3
is the same as saying .999.. = 1. We are taught that .333...= 1/3,&nbsp;
.666...=2/3 and so on. We say that because these decimals are the closest way to
express these fractions. Instead of convincing me that .999...=1, Mr. Cohen
convinced me that against the common teaching, 1/3 does not&nbsp; equal .333...
and 2/3 is not = .666...</p>
<p>I had full belief of the school teaching until now.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
We talked about a monotonic increasing sequence which is bounded above,
converges, has a limit. And I always bring out this quote from Morris Kline that
is in my book: &quot;In his first paper on the Calculus (1669), Newton proudly
introduced the use of infinite series to expedite the processes of the
calculus...<br>
As Newton, Leibnitz, the several Bernoullis, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and
other 18th-century men struggled with the strange problem of infinite series and
employed them in analysis, they perpetuated all sorts of blunders, made false
proofs, and drew incorrect conclusions; they even gave arguments that now with
hindsight we are obliged to call ludicrous.&quot;<br>
-from MATHEMATICS THE LOSS OF CERTAINTY by Morris Kline
<p><br>
Katie said she was confused about the limit of a series and I'm saying that's
OK, for Newton and the other biggies in mathematics were also confused!</p>

This went as shown in chapter 11 in the worksheet book, findind the amout she
would have after 1 year @4% interest, compounding the interest 4 times per year,
12 times per year, daily, 10,0000 times per year. We connected this to finding
the limit of (1+.04/n)^n as n-&gt; inf and found that the approach the same

One of Katie's discoveries came in her work here. We talked We worked on <font size="4">i</font><font size="2"><sup>0</sup>
= </font><font size="3">1</font><font size="2">,</font>
 <font size="4">i</font><font size="2"><sup>1</sup> = </font>

to <font size="4">i</font><sup>125</sup>= </font> <font size="4">i</font><font size="3">.
Then I had her graph <font size="4">i</font><font size="2"><sup><b>n</b></sup></font>
in the complex plane, where n is an integer. <img align="middle" src="../images/katie1.jpg" width="407" height="310">After
graphing the first 5 points, I asked her where&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font size="3"> <font size="4">i</font><font size="2"><sup>1/2</sup></font>
would be on the graph. Katie said it would be on a circle(!!) and marked the x
at the point (3/4, 3/4 <b>i</b>). Almost everyone else I had asked this question, said
it would be on the square formed by the points plotted. We agreed that if the x
was on the circle, the length of the red segment above, would be 1. Katie used
Pythagoras and found the length of the red segment to be Sqrt{(3/4)^2 + (3/4)^2}
= Sqrt{18/16} = (3*Sqrt 2)/4 which turns out to be more than 1.<br>
<img align="middle" src="../images/katiec2.jpg" width="286" height="309"></font>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Katie then sketched in the arc of the circle and
put the x on the circle at 45 degrees, like that above.<br>
To find the point on the circle, I decided we should do some trigonometry. <center><img src="../images/katiec3.jpg" width="407" height="310"></center></p>
<p align="left">Starting here, Katie graphed y=sin x, and I asked her to 1). get
the equation of the sine wave that was twice as tall, 2). get the equation of
the sine wave that had 2 waves in 360 degrees, and 3). get the equation of the
sine wave that was shifted 60 degrees to the left. She found these to be y=2sin
x, y= sin(2x) and y=sin(x+60) respectively. She also saw the cosine on the
dot-circle.</p>
<p align="left">Then we went back to the problem of&nbsp; finding <b><font size="4" face="Arial"><font size="4">i</font></font></b></font><b><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>1/2</sup></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><sup>
</sup></font></b><font size="3">above. She realized it would be cos 45 + <b>i </b>sine
45. She then squared cos 45 + <b>i </b>sine 45, and got <b>i. </b>This discussion
with Katie was very exciting!</p>

Graphing</b></font></p>
Katie graphed y=x^2 and then she proceeded to move the parabola up and down,
then left and right, made the parabola skinnier, and flipped it over the x-axis
and even got into y=x^3 and y=x^4 accidently. She also graphed y=2^x -1 (from
the tower puzzle) and y=2^x and we looked at sa problem in cell growth.</font>

a while and she did some problems on an algebra 2 test and realized she knew
quite a bit. Katie was going to be taking an algebra 2 class in the Fall.</font></p>

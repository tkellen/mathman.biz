<b>1.</b> The rule can be written various ways, like x+x+3=y and 2x+3=y 

<br><hr><b>2. </b>Below is the graph of x+y=7<br>

<br>Notice, I will get young people into negative numbers and adding 
mixed numbers while doing the graphs. Is there a pattern to the graph? 
Follow the pattern. I may have to show a youngster how to 
write negative 1 or 2 1/2. They pick up on this quickly 
though! <p>
The graphing is a very important piece of mathematics involving 
arithmetic (getting the numbers), algebra (the equation), and 
geometry (the points). Now we can ask some questions, like what 
could you change? How could you make the graph different? What if 
you graphed x - y = 2 or xy=12 ? Try these.<hr>
<b>3. and 
4.</b> These are the graphs of the shuttle puzzle (a parabola), tower 
puzzle (an exponential function) and another to compare with 
these.

<hr><b>5.</b> For the <b>Nautilus shell</b>, <center>
<img
src="../images/nau&eq.gif" width="511" height="311"> </center>the ratio of 
radius vectors 
every 360 degrees is a constant, about 3.2. My students average their 
mesurements and get pretty close to that (within 10%). The angle 
comes out another constant, about 79.5 degrees; this spiral is called an 
equiangular spiral because of this. A number of young people have worked 
on these problems of the Nautilus shell. Vickie, a 9th grader at the 
time, used the half-shell, and studied the volume increase from section 
to section. I have a full and half shell in my 
"Math Room". The shell is beautiful and mathematical, that's why it is my 
logo. The shell on my first web site page is a copy of a watercolor 
painting I did of the shell. The rubbing is on the left. The polar equation of the shell spiral is r = 
<b>e</b><sup><font 
size= -1>t * cot (79.5*Pi/180)</font></sup> The polar plot of this 
equation in <I>Mathematica</I> looks like that at right above. You can see when t 
=0, r =1. A 360 degree 
turn (t=2*Pi) gives an r of about 3.2, and the Nautilus grows at this constant 
ratio throughout (as mentioned above). (See Frank 
Land's book "The Language of Mathematics", Doubleday, 1963)<br><hr><b>6.</b>

 Notice that in the chart above, we get an 
infinite sequence whose limit is 4. As the animal gets smaller, like a 
mouse,  its SA/Vol ratio is largest (the white or smallest rod). The skin 
(measured by the surface area) acts to rid the body of perspiration, and 
the mass (proportional to the volume) is a measure of the heat 
production. If the mouse ran around during sunny days, it would lead to 
"excessive transpiration" and die. That's why rodents are noctunal 
animals. This ratio is also why we grate cheese before putting it on 
spaghetti and one person told me he likes thin spaghetti because the 
cheese gets on more of it! <hr>

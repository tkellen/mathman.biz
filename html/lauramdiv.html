<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>While iterating a function, Laura, a 4th
grader, divides 7.75 by 2- WOW!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000">Don started Laura with the
function 5 + x/2. Laura picked 1 to put in for x. She got 5 + 1/2 = 5 1/2 and
5.50 as the decimal. So they started 2 sequences, one written as fractions, one
written as decimals:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000">1, 5 1/2, </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000">1,&nbsp; 5.50, </font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000">(Iteration (or feedback) means
to put in a number for x, do the arithmetic and get an output number; then one
takes this new output number and uses it as the new input number, getting an </font><font size="4" color="#800000">infinite
sequence</font><font size="4" color="#008000">).</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000">So Laura put 5 1/2 in for x,
divided by 2, then added 5. She got 7 3/4 and 7.75 as the output number. She
then used 7.75 as the new input number. Don left Laura to her work as she divided 7.75 by
2. When he came back-what a pleasant surprise he had!</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000" size="4">Laura got 3 1/2 and&nbsp; 3
1/2 /10 and 2 1/2/100, WOW!&nbsp; Laura did most of the work to write these as
decimals, then she added up 3.5 + .35 + .025 = 3.875. She then added this to 5
to get 8.875 the new output number. Time ran out as they discussed the fraction name
for 8.875. Tune in next time to see what this sequence approaches- what do you
think?</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#800000">Why was Don excited about
this? Because Don had dreamed that Laura's method of division was possible, but
he had never seen a student in 55 years do the whole thing as Laura did! Don had
her change the answer to the &quot;normal&quot; form, so that if Laura showed
this to her teacher the teacher would understand it. Don finds that in school
math, the student is often </font><font size="4" color="#FF0000"> marked wrong</font><font size="4" color="#800000"> if the answer doesn't look like that in
the answer book </font><font size="4" color="#FF0000"> or isn't done the way the teacher expects
it</font><font size="4" color="#800000">. This is also a
good case for students to use a calculator. Eventually Don will use <i>Mathematica</i>
to do thousands of iterations and have Laura see what happens.</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">I am living in ___, Japan and bought your &quot;Calculus
By and For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot;&nbsp;a few years ago for my
8 year-old daughter, who is now in Grade 3 of an International School in ___.
And so she can communicate with anybody in English for her age. I hope that she
will work/study with you for around one week of this summer in 2007 and this
experience will be wonderful for her. Therefore I have some inquiries to ask.&nbsp;
Where in Champaign will she stay and can she alone stay there or is any parent
needed to accompany her while all staying days? And is it possible for her to
continue any other summer camp programs (e.g. sports or language course) held in
Champaign for another week? Thank you for your kindness in advance. I wish that
Champaign's summer days would come true.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial"><font color="#800000"><b>Don
started Nanako on graphing linear equations, specifically x+y=8&nbsp;
below,&nbsp; because she is
8 years old. She picked up the plotting points quickly and proceeded to find
pairs of numbers with negatives numbers, like 9+<font size="5" color="#800000"><sup>-</sup></font></b></font><b><font color="#800000">1=
8 and plotted (9,</font></b><font color="#800000"><b><font size="5" color="#800000"><sup>-</sup></font></b></font><b><font color="#800000">1)
and (10,</font></b><font color="#800000"><b><font size="5" color="#800000"><sup>-</sup></font></b></font><b><font color="#800000">2)
and (</font></b><font color="#800000"><b><font size="5" color="#800000"><sup>-</sup></font></b></font><b><font color="#800000">1,9).
Then Don asked her to get the numbers for a point half way between 2 others, and
proceeded to get (3<font size="2"> 1/2, </font>4<font size="2"> 1/2) </font><font size="3">and
she knew that </font>3<font size="2"> 1/2 + </font>4<font size="2"> 1/2 = 8.</font></font></b></span></p>

<br>
</o:p></font><font color="#800000">Then Don asked her to change one thing in the
equation, like x+y=4; what would the graph look like? She said it would be
smaller (whatever she meant, I wasn't sure). She proceeded to graph this
equation above. Don told her that the lines will never meet and are parallel.
Again Don asked her to change something in the equation. This time she said she
would try to get a line that went like this / instead of like \. She said she
would move the y-axis to the right, and she proceeded to make the negative numbers on the
x-axis go down to the right, and the positive numbers get bigger to the left!!!
Don had never seen anyone do this before, he was very excited! Here is her graph
using the <u> same equation</u>:</font></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>That's exactly what
she was trying to do! WOW!! Don asked Nanako how she came to do this, and after
thinking about that, she said, &quot;it just popped into my head&quot;!</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#800000"><b>Don went over the
fact that a point like (2,2) marked with the x, was not on the line and the pair
of numbers do not make the sentence true, 2+2 = 8 is False. Only the pairs of
numbers that make x+y=8 true, will be on that line.</b></font></p>

Nanako!</b></font></p>

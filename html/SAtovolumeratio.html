<p align="left"><font size="2">Kelda, age 11, filled in a chart like the one
that Maya, age 8, did below. Don talked to each (at different times), about
comparing their ages. Maya was 8 and Don 80; Maya said Don was 72 year older
than she by subtracting. Don said we could also compare our ages by a <font color="#FF0000"> ratio</font> or
division. The ratio of Don's age to Maya's age was 80/8 = 10/1. Don was 10
times as old as Maya. And Maya was 1/8 as old as Don. Don and Kelda had a
similar discussion. Don showed them the rods: </font></p>

<p align="left">He showed them the length of the white rod as 1 centimeter on an
edge, the surface area was 1 cm<sup>2 </sup> on a face, and 6 cm<sup>2 </sup> (6
square centimeters) total, and the volume was 1 cm<sup>3 </sup> (1 cubic
centimeter). The ratio of the surface area to volume&nbsp; went in the
right-hand column, 6. </p>
<p align="left">For the red rod the length was 2 cm, the SA was 10 cm<sup>2 </sup>-4*2
around the side faces and 2 for the top and bottom. (Darshan also said adding
the white to the white, the SA would increase 6 + 6, but you would have to take
away 2 where the rods come together and would again be 10- a different way of
looking at this!) The volume was 2 cm<sup>3</sup>.
The SA/Vol ratio for the red rod was 10/2 = 5. The SA went up 4,
the length and volume went up 1 each time.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/mayasatovol.jpg" width="656" height="861"></p>
<p align="left">Maya and Kelda both saw the pattern in the ratios 4 2/3, 4 2/4,
4 2/5, and they were getting smaller as the size of the rod got bigger. (Darshan
also saw that 5=4 2/2 and 6 = 4+ 2/1 to keep the pattern from the beginning)! With
Kelda and Darshan, they divided (4L+2)/L to get 4+2/L. Don talked with them about when they
ran and played in the sun they sweated. The white rod was small like the mouse
and had the largest SA/Vol ratio. The surfce area determines how much water goes
out the skin for a given volume. If the mouse ran around in the sun it would die
quickly because of water loss, so they are nocturnal animals, running around at
night. Don also talked with Kelda about what happens to 4 + 2/L as L gets larger
and larger. 2/L approaches 0, so the sequence approaches 4, the limit of this
infinite sequence.</p>

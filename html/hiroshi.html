<h3 align="left"><font color="#cc0033"><b><font size="4">Mr. Hiroshi Takimoto</font></b></font>,
a JUKU owner and math teacher, from Matsuyama, Japan, is completely responsible 
for the CD-ROM with Don's worksheet book in&nbsp; Japanese and English. Mr. Takimoto
had Don's worksheet book translated and had each page put in pdf files so that
it can be read on a PC computer by Adobe Acrobat Reader, and did all the other
work <i>and spent his own money!</i>, to make this CD come about. <a href="http://www.dokidoki.ne.jp/home2/letitbe/don.htm">Mr.
Takimoto sells it on his website </a>.</h3>
<p>Mr. Takimoto also found Kodansha Ltd., who published the Japanese
translation, by Noriko Arai, of Don's book &quot;Calculus By and For Young
People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)&quot; on August 20, 1998. On April 20, 2001
Kodansha also published the Japanese version of Don's third book &quot;Changing Shapes With
Matrices&quot;, co-authored by Ms. Arai.

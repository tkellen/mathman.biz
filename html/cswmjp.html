<p>Don received an email on 2/2/01 from Mr. Ozawa at Kodansha Ltd. , &quot;..
I&nbsp; am sorry that it's been taking time to prepare publishing the matrix
book. <span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
 </span>I&nbsp; happy to tell you that Dr. Arai has done the translation, and we
decided to <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">publish the book in April.&quot;</span></p>
<p>This is exciting because Don, as usual, does his teaching in a different way
than is normally done in schools! He tries to use what children have already
done, to do new things. During the week of August 21, 2000, Dr. Arai wrote
Don.&nbsp; It seems Don's way of&nbsp; multiplying&nbsp; matrices- a 1x2 matrix
[x y], which is natural to young people from graphing points like (x,y), times
the 2x2 transformation matrix, is different from the way this is taught in
schools in Japan. (See the sample problems from <a href="probcswm.html">Don's
English book </a>). In Japanese schools, as well as in other countries, students
are taught to multiply the 2x2 matrix by a&nbsp; 2x1 matrix, the x above the y.
She suggested we have a small chapter to show why the multiplying in this book
is different from how teachers do it in Japan. Don wrote this couple of pages
and they decided to put it as a foreword to the book.</p>
<p>In June, 2000, Ms. Arai came to the UI for a math conference. She and Don met
to organize their book &quot;Changing Shapes With Matrices&quot;. The
anticipated publication date by Kodansha is &quot;early 2001&quot; !</p>
<p>In March 2000, Don sent corrections and additions to Kodansha. These were
received and Kodansha was satisfied that this would fulfill our plans.</p>
<p>Jan. 2000 Don has agreed to make further additions and have his book
co-authored by Dr. Arai (she is translating this to Japanese and also making
additions).</p>
<p>April 15, 1999: Don received the signed contract from Kodansha that they will
translate and publish this book.
<p>Nov.'98-Mar.'99 Don made corrections and additions as asked by Kodansha.
<p>In November, 1998 Kodansha expressed interest in publishing this book after
publishing Don's first book, &quot;Calculus By and For Young people (ages 7, yes
7 and up)&quot;.

</font></span>Hi Don, <span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p></span>How are you? I'm fine. You know what? I got a 500 in the
SAT in the mathematics section! So I got a scholarship to the 2002 Young
Scholars Program (for the month of July 2002!). I hope when I am in eighth
grade, I will be able to get a total of 1400 points on the SAT. <o:p>
</o:p>Thanks for all your help, <o:p>

fantastic!&nbsp;He is very gifted in math and has finished most of our

and do his math with him so that he has an alternative to 2nd grade math (he
skipped kindergarten).&nbsp; Is there any chance we could come and do some math
with you?&nbsp; He loves to find patterns and analyze problems and work with
other people in math.&nbsp; What do you suggest?&nbsp; I am groping around to
try and find some exciting alternatives for him.</font<b>Thank you.<o:p>

working on infinite series in Ch. 1 of Don's worksheet book. She had figured
that 1/2 + (1/2)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">

</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">+ (1/3)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>4
</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">+ ... -&gt; 1/2. She graphed the
partial sums at home for the infinite series 1/4 + (1/4)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">
</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">+ (1/4)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>3

</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">+ ... Emily realized that 1/3 = 5
1/3/16 and the partial sum&nbsp; 5/16 (1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16) can be written as 1/3
- (1/3)(1/16) = 5 1/3/16 - (1/3)(1/16) = 5/16.&nbsp; Each partial sum then, can
be written as 1/3 - (1/3)(1/4)</font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">n </font></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">and
as n-&gt;infinity, (1/4)</font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">n</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">
goes to 0, and 1/3 - (1/3)(1/4)</font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">n</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;

</sup></font><font face="Arial" size="3">+ ... goes to 1/3. Emily saw the
pattern of the other infinite series and this one, and generalized that the
infinite series 1/n + (1/n)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>2</sup></font><sup><font face="Arial" size="2">
</font></sup><font face="Arial" size="3">+ (1/n)</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><sup>3

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#800080">&quot;..We really want to thank
you for your help in getting Jonathan started on a successful path in
mathematics. As you can see [8 pages of his awards and records in HS] it has led
to an exciting future career. He thinks that he might be interested in proving
or disproving &quot;string theory&quot;, but is open minded and wants to learn
about all branches of physics when he starts out at Cornell. Your enthusiasm for
math has set such a shining example for Jonathan and our whole family as you
have pursued a life long love of mathematics and learning. We greatly appreciate
your interest in Jonathan and your help over the years&quot;.</font></p>

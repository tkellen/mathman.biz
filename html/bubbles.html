<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dallas observes the bubbles in the
tetrahedron.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial" size="3"><b>Two ways</b></font><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><font color="#0000FF">
to make the bubbles:</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">1. Wire shapes with handles: a
tetrahedron, a cube, and a ring (~5 in. diameter) with a loop of string
attached.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">2. Two clear plastic squares or
plates, each ~5&quot;x5&quot; and 1/4&quot; thick with 3 tacks (to begin with),
head down, between the plates (get a box of tacks- 1/2&quot; head, 1/2&quot;
point which are larger than regular tacks).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Procedure:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Make the bubble mixture, keeping the
top fairly clear of small bubbles. Keep the bucket covered when not in use to
keep out bugs. Keep a bath towel under the bucket so kids can dry their hands.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#008000">Just dip the shape
in the bubble-water slowly, pulling it out slowly, and observe the resulting
bubbles within the shapes. The bubbles formed are beautiful!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#008000">Students immediately
want to make their own shapes, including the standard ones as well as
non-standard ones like 'stars' and 'spheres'..very interesting! And they were
anxious to show their parents what happens, as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#800000">Manipulating the
plates takes a little time to get the technique to get 'clean' bubbles. Put
three tacks head down between the plastic plates. Dip the plates at an angle
down into the water. Then come out of the water at an angle up, and slowly. See
the diagram below which show the bubbles formed between the plates with 3 tacks.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/3tacks.jpg" width="225" height="113"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">It turns out that that the bubbles formed are
vertical rectangles, 120<sup>o</sup> apart.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><b>Some student work as a
result of &quot;playing&quot; with the bubbles:</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Patricia and Joe who did the work below
during the summer of 2000, will take geometry in the Fall of 2000. Other
students ages 9 and up did similar work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Patricia drew the 3-tack bubble diagram below
right. She started with a point at the center, drew lines off at 120<sup>o</sup>
and at arbitrary distances put the points that represented the tacks, forming
the picture shown above within the plates. She then connected the three points
in a triangle. She measured the distances for the three paths between the
&quot;tacks&quot; sketched at the left.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/patbubble.jpg" width="439" height="264"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Patricia found the bubble path, the inverted
Y,&nbsp; was 100 mm and was 62% of the triangle perimeter of 169 mm., and 82% of
the inverted V length of 112 mm. Stevens in his book&nbsp; &quot;<font color="#FF0000">Patterns
in Nature</font>&quot; on p.171, shows 58% and 87% for these same corresponding
path lengths. Patricia's data was very good, with errors of only about 7% and
6%, respectively. Fine job, Patricia!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The following is Maggie's work for the three
tacks:</font></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/mparker.jpg" width="578" height="377"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The 4-tack bubble looked like the <font color="#FF0000">PINK</font>
path below, drawn by Joe. He started with a line segment, came off the endpoints
at 120<sup>o</sup> then marked the 4 points for the tacks. He measured the paths
and found the bubble path to be 92% of the green path (3-sides of the rectangle)
and 95% of the blue diagonal path. Stevens shows 91% and 94% for the
corresponding %'s, with errors here of only 1%! Very fine job, Joe!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img align="right" src="../images/jo120.jpg" width="109" height="244">Don asked Joe
if he could start with the 4 tacks and&nbsp; make the bubble path from those.
They talked about starting with two points P1 and P2 first, then locating a
point that made an angle of 120<sup>o</sup> with these points. He found</font><font face="Arial">
one point, then proceeded to find many. The locus (or path) of these points he
found was a curve. Then he realized there would be other points that would be
mirror images of the first ones. These were the ones to the right of P2. Don
realized the curve could <b>not</b> be</font><font face="Arial"> a circle with
diameter P1P2, because a circle would contain points that made an angle of 90<sup>o</sup>
with P1P2 as diameter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Don found the locus of the points (x,y), that make an
angle of 120º with the points P1 and P2.</b> The three vertices of the triangle
are&nbsp; (x,y), P1 and&nbsp; P2.&nbsp; He used the distance between P1 and
P2&nbsp; as 1, and the coordinates of P1 as (0,1/2) and P2 as (0, -1/2). He used
the law of cosines relating 2 sides of a triangle and the angle between them to
the third side (P1-P2), that is opposite the 120º angle. The law of cosines is</font></p>

<p align="left">The middle portion of this graph, looks very much like Joe's
diagram; the two &quot;pieces&quot; he had must be parts of the two ellipses.
(When Don simplified the equation above and graphed that equation, he did <b>not</b>
get two ellipses, only one! So there is still a question in his mind about
that.)</p>

size is better, but it is hard to find.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" face="Arial" size="4">The work below is from a later
chapter (not too much later!)</font></p>
<p align="left">Don set up the complex sand pendulum in the math room. The
strings at the top are adjustable so one can change the total height of the
pendulum (pendulum #1). The strings come together to form a smaller pendulum
(pendulum #2) and are held together by an alligator clip so this height can be
changed. The sand is in a ketchup bottle. When the ketchup bottle is pulled off
center, the pendulums will swing, perpendicularly, forming &quot;Lissajous&quot;
figures like the one shown in Sheri's drawing. The pattern in the sand is
determined by the ratio of the frequencies of the 2 pendulums (in this case
3:2).</p>

<font face="Arial">Jonathan graphs y=sin x, then finds the three equation which
(a) doubles the height, (b) has twice as many waves and (c) shifts the sine wave
60 degrees to the right.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jonathan combines cos x and sin x at right angles. The
resultant Lissajous figure is in the upper left hand corner of each figure.
(N.B. I scanned Jonathan's graphs, you would think I would get better at making
these diagrams the same size in the paint program! ;-))</font> <center><img src="../images/sincos.gif" width="303" height="305"></center>

<font face="Arial">After doing these, Jonathan worked with a complex sand
pendulum which made Lissajous figures by dropping sand on a piece of paper. The
we proceeded to get the same figures by using parametric equations in
Mathematica!</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><img align="left" src="../images/ellipse.jpg" width="207" height="218">Joey,
a 3rd grader (not in the picture), had made an ellipse using the simple sand
pendulum. When Don mentioned that the ellipse is the path of the earth around
the sun, Joey asked, &quot;Then why don't we have 2 winters!?&quot; Joey was
thinking, and a good idea, that the sun was at the center of the ellipse, when
in fact the sun is at one of the 2 foci of the ellipse (not at the center).</font>

let her use Derive5 to do these graphs. Don scanned these, and adjusted
the size of each.</font></p>

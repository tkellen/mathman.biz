<h3><center>ON A CIRCULAR GEOBOARD, Michael, a 9th grader &amp; Christie,
getting ready for college, find the angle formed by 2 chords intersecting within
a circle (not at the center).</h3>
&nbsp;</center>On the circular geoboard, Michael and Christie found the number
of degrees between the nails (24 nails, 15 degrees apart), then found the number
of degrees in a central angle= the number of degrees in its intercepted arc.
Then they found that the number of degrees in an inscribed angle is 1/2 its
intercepted arc.
<p>Then I gave them the problem of finding the angle x formed by 2 chords EB and
DA, intersecting within a circle at F(not at the center). This was a very
exciting event!<br>

They drew a chord DC parallel to EB (same number of degrees in the arcs ED and
BC). By corresponding angles, angle x = angle y. Angle y is an inscribed angle
whose intercepted arc is AC = 120 degrees. Therefore angle y=1/2 of 120 = 60
degrees, and then angle x = 60 degrees!<br>
I thought that was a very unique and simple way of finding angle x...don't you
agree?<br>
One could show that this is equivalent to what we read about in most geometry
books- try that.

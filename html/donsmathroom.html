The table about which expectations are high, the students are all different, we study, ask questions, look for
patterns, visualize the math, graph functions, read, play a game like Nim, or
Conway's &quot;The Game of Life&quot; or &quot;Racetrack&quot;, learn to learn,
think about the math, look at a sunflower stalk, and do a problem different
ways. Whereas some people have been known to &quot;stand and deliver&quot;, a
student once told Don he sits and listens-&nbsp; and we have fun!</p>

head, measuring tools (rulers, hypsometer, angle measurer, map measurer,
miras,..), guess my rule cards, tangrams, counters, rotograms,.. On top of this
cabinet are cylindrical cans, bottles, a cone of string, shapes made out of
white rods that where then doubled and tripled in each length to compare the
volume ratios, blocks to make (A+B)<sup><b><font size="2">3 </font></b></sup><font size="3">,..</font>
The black file cabinet contains folders kept up to date by students who don't
have a notebook. On top of the black cabinet is a globe and a bag of white

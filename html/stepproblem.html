<p align="center"><b><font size="5" face="Arial">This is the Step Problem that 
was sent to Don</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Arial">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: #008000">There are a 
total of n steps to reach the top. You can go either 1-step or 2-steps at a 
time.&nbsp; How many different ways you can go to reach the top?</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Instead of trying to see if the problem 
conformed to some mathematical idea, like binomial expansion or combinations, 
Don tried a number of steps for n, like 5. He had his students also do the same. 
The diagram at the left&nbsp; below, shows the 5 steps and the bottom or zero 
step.</font></p>

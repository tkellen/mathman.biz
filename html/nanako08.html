Nanako came a second summer from Japan, June 16-21, 2008 to work with Don!</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#FF00FF"><font size="5">The

16, 2008</b></font><p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#008000">After
greeting Nanako and her Mum outside, they all went down to the mathroom. Don had
copies of Nanako's math curriculum downloaded from her school website, Nanako's
work from last summer and her notebooks from her 4th grade work at her school.
Don decided to see what Nanako could do with fractions, decimals and percents;
he made the chart below in her notebook that she had used last summer. He wrote
in 1/2 in the first row, .47 in the second row and 33 1/3 % in the third row.
Nanako's job was to fill in the equivalent names in that row.&nbsp;She did fine
on the first 2 rows, 1/2 = 0.5 = 50% and .47 = 47/100 = 47%. Then Nanako had a difficult time with 33 1/3 %.</font><font size="3" color="#FF0000">

<p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#008000">They talked about her answer
of 33.333 as a decimal and 3333/100 as a fraction and ended up with .333... =
.33 1/3 as a decimal and 33.333.../100 = 33 1/3 / 100 then tried to simplify
this. In the next to the last line above, she made equivalent fractions for 33
1/3 / 100 (thirty three and one third hundredths) as 50ths, 200ths, then Don
suggested multiplying top and bottom by 3 and she ended up with 100/300 = 50/150
= 25/75 = 1/3. Don showed Nanako she could use 100/300 and divide top and bottom
by 100 to get 1/3 directly. In the process she took half of 33 1/3 to get 16 1/2
+ 1/2 of 1/3 = 16 2/3 using the picture above. So Nanako did 1/2</font><font color="#008000" size="4"><sub>*</sub></font><font size="3" color="#008000">1/3
= 1/6 and 1/2 + 1/6 = 2/3, which was good stuff!&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#008000">Don asked Nanako if she bought
a shirt for 6000 Yen and received a 33 1/3% discount, how much would she pay for
it? The discount would be 1/3*6000= 2000, then she would pay 6000-2000 = </font><font size="3" color="#800080">4000
Yen (100Yen=~$1)</font><font size="3" color="#008000">. Another way to look at that was, if
the discount was 1/3, then she would pay 2/3 of the regular price or 2/3*6000 = </font><font size="3" color="#800080">4000
Yen</font><font size="3" color="#008000">.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#008000">Then Don tried to get Nanako to
do some percents in her head. Like take 10% of 200. 10%=1/10, so divide 200 by
10 = 20. Then 5% of 200 is 1/2 of 10% of 200 = 10 and 15% of 200 is (10%+5%) of
200 = 20 +10 = 30. They talked about 10% of&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../images/box.GIF" width="16" height="17">

= 20 , multiplying both sides by 10, you get <img border="0" src="../images/box.GIF" width="16" height="17">&nbsp;
= 200. At one point, after Don wrote that 1/10 = 10%, Nanako wrote that 1/5 = 5%
and 1/15=15% and 1/20 = 20%. But with a couple of questions from Don, </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4">she</font><font size="3" color="#008000">
figured these out to get the correct answers.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">To keep Mum from getting nervous about
Nanako's mistakes, </font><font color="#000000"> Don asked her to solve the equation&nbsp; 2x + 5 = x -
7</font><font color="#008000">,
that is, find a number that would make this sentence true. Mum proceeded to do
the normal thing, subtracting 5 from both sides (except she thought of
&quot;moving things to the other side&quot;)- see her arrows. She got to x = x/2 - 6.
Then Don realized that Mum had the correct answer x = <font size="4"><sup>-</sup></font><sup>
</sup>12.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Nanako08/hinakoiter.jpg" width="702" height="525"></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">At this point Don decided to show Mum
how to iterate x/2 - 6. Don asked her to try a number in for x; she chose <font size="4"><sup>-</sup>
</font>4 above.&nbsp; She did the arithmetic, <font size="4"><sup>-</sup> </font>4/2 -
6 = <font size="4"><sup>-</sup> </font>8. She then put <font size="4"><sup>-</sup>

never saw before-great!) : <font size="4"><sup>-</sup>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#008000" size="4">So, in solving a simple linear
equation as Mum did, one can iterate a function X/2 - 6, and get an infinite

equations like x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0 answers {2,3} and proceeded to find
the 2 secrets in solving these equations. She even found the answers to x<sup>2</sup>
- 25x + 24 = 0 and x<sup>2</sup>
- 6 1/2x + 9 = 0 and made up three quadratic
equations for Don to figure out.&nbsp; [The math genes

can jump, but only one peg and it must be of the other color, and 3) you can't
move backwards. You must start with the empty space in the middle and end that

</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">what it should be. His students
giggled at this, but it was very important he said. Then one had to test the
quess, do some experiments, and if it didn't work throw it away! So when Don has
his students guessing to solve equations, he feels confident that he is going in
the right direction.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<o:p>

<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">1) you start off

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">2) it gets you into
the problem, you don't have to have this &quot;I haven't been taught this, so I
can't do it &quot; attitude and then feel you have to wait for someone to tell
you how to solve it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">3) you can solve
many equations this way, not a trivial few, as well as solving other types of
problems. Don't be discouraged if you guess wrong the first few times; keep
trying, you can do it. Along with guessing goes the question-are you getting
closer? Is the guess too big or too small?<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="12pointHelvetica"><span style="font-family:Arial">4) you'll also get
better at guessing. And <o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial">5) you might even
come up with different ways to solve the same problem, which would be very good.

when taking a test, and without having to rely on someone else to tell you.</span></p>

y-numbers, they go up 4 each time. That was correct, is important and is called a
recursive rule, to get from one y to the next. Don said that 4 was an important number in
the rule -which Jack later proved Don wrong in what he did! Then Don asked Jack
if he put in 100 for the input number,&nbsp; what would the machine give

Don and Anna listened carefully to what Jack was saying, but he couldn't write
the rule. Don had Jack's rule, but he asked Anna</font></b><font size="4"><b><font color="#008000">  to
write the rule that Jack was describing. Anna first wrote x-1<sup>.</sup> 3 + x
= y. Don suggested she needed parentheses around the x-1, because they would
have to multiply 1 times 3 before subtracting from x (the order of operations).

<p align="left"><b><font size="4" color="#008000" face="Arial">Don didn't think of it then,
but would wait for their next session to have them show algebraically that both written rules were equivalent.</font></b></p>

<p>4 months later Don asked Anna to make up another rule for him: the first 3
pairs were (0,1), (1,0), and (2,1). Don responded that another pair would be
(3,4), she said yes, and Don told her the rule was y= (x-1)<font size="2"><b><sup>2&nbsp;</sup> </b></font><font size="3">.
Anna took a moment to say my rule worked and</font><b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="3">she
had written x</font><font size="2"><sup><b>2</b></sup><b><sup> </sup></b></font><font size="3">-
2x +1. If you look at Anna's earlier work, this was part of a problem in which
she found the distance between 3 points. <a href="annaL.html">Check out what she
did then</a> at the bottom of this file.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">One week later while Don was working with Jack, he looked over
at Ann. She took a 3x5&quot; card and Don said, aha, &quot;I see the evil eyes
of Anna, You must be about to make up a nasty rule for me, right?&quot;
&quot;Yes, she smiled!&quot; Here is the card as Don wrote down her numbers:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/annaLgmr.jpg" width="294" height="494"></p>
<p align="left">Don worked on this for about 2 hours. Jerry, a 5th grader, came
in and figured it out in about 20 minutes- and found only one mistake (-1,2) in
Anna's rule! Can you do it. (hint: Anna told Don that it is an exponential
function).</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">At the same time Anna gave Don the rule above, Jack, in 3rd grade, made up
the following rule for him: This time Don gave him 0, Jack said 7 and then
(1,7.75) and (2, 8.5). At this time Don said he knew Jack's rule and Don
wrote <img border="0" src="../images/34frac.gif" width="14" height="32">x +7= y. Jack had written x<img border="0" src="../images/divsymbol.gif" width="11" height="11">4<b><font size="1"><sup>x</sup>
</font></b><font size="3">3+7=y. Jack asked Don..&quot;how did you get
that&quot;? Don explained to Jack that he went up in the y's the same amount
(.75 = 3/4) each time, so it was a linear function- the form is mx + b = y, a
straight line when graphed. And the 0 goes to 7, which is the y-intercept (b,
where the graph crosses the y-axis). His rule was was then&nbsp; </font><img border="0" src="../images/34frac.gif" width="14" height="32">x +7=

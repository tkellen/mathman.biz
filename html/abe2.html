<p><font size="3">I had Abe, a 6th grader, doing powers of&nbsp; I, then had him
graph I<sup>n </sup>on graph paper in the complex plane. He graphed I<sup>1</sup>
and I<sup>2</sup>, I<sup>3</sup> and I<sup>4</sup> (see above). Then I asked him
where I<sup>1/2</sup> would be. He picked up my TI85 and put in square root of
(-1). Now I had never tried this before. He got (0,1) which was the point
(0,1i)! Then he took the square root of the square root of -1. This gave
(.707..., .707...) and he graphed this point. Abe said this would be I<sup>1/2</sup>.
He went further on the graph to get points on a circle, (and I went into trig
with him from there- to show the I<sup>1/2</sup> would be (cos 45, sine 45), but
as his teacher, I had never tried this before...really exciting!</font></p>

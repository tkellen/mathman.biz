Don's Worksheet book on CD from Rainbow Resource Center].&nbsp;</b></font></p>

work on, then he talked to each to see what they were doing.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

on solving about 5 quadratic equations, from x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0,
figuring out the secrets of finding the solutions, to x<sup>2</sup> -&nbsp; 6
1/2 x + 9 = 0. This last one gave her a hard time because she went for finding
the two numbers that multiply to give 9 and got into decimals quickly. Don
helped by suggesting finding two numbers that add to 6 1/2 first; then it only
took a couple of guesses to get 2 and 4 1/2. Don then asked Esther to make up a
quadratic equation for Don to solve and her first attempt didn't work- she
didn't have the two answers. Don suggested she pick the answers, then make the
equation and that worked for her. Esther also solved one quadratic equations by
getting x=5 - 6/x, then iterating the right side. </font><font color="#800000">See

a pattern with the square numbers, like that below. She originally mixed up a
square number and the square root of a number, but we easily fixed that. The
picture below is like the one Hannah made, but Don didn't get to scan her
picture and had to use one that Tara, his granddaughter made.</font></b>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#008000">The square numbers are on the
left and the odd numbers, the differences between the square numbers, 4-1 = 3,
9-4=5, etc. are on top. Hannah saw the pattern that the differences go up 2 each
time.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

negatives, which she knew.</font></b></p>

number. Is your number on card A? Is your number on card B? &quot; and so on
through card E. If the person says their number is on cards A, B and D, for
example, you add the numbers in the upper left hand corner of those cards A, B
and D, or 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 which is the person's number! Now try this on your

linear equations -see chapter 8- like 2x + 3 = 17 {7}, and</b> </font>
<b><font color="#008000">2x + 3 = 18, for which 7 was too
small and 8 was too big, so she tried 7 1/2 and that worked. Then Don gave her
3x + 4 = 11. 2 was&nbsp; too small and 3 too big. She tried 2 1/2 and found this
too big. So she realized the number had to be between 2 and 2 1/2. She said 2
1/4, and 2 1/16 were&nbsp; between 2 and 2 1/2 and Don agreed. Then he showed
Estelle when she had the 2x+3=18 and tried 7 1/2,&nbsp; 2 x 7 1/2 =15; she got a
whole number when the fraction in the denominator was 2 and the multiplying number was 2. Now
they had the multiplying number 3, and they want to get a whole number 7, to add to
4 to = 11. She thought she could try 2 1/3 in for x in 3x + 4 = 11 and that
worked.&nbsp;</font></b>

years old. </font><font size="3" color="#800000">Don asked John if he could give
him 2 numbers that add to 7. He came up with 1 and 6. Don wrote the pair in the

go up 6 </font><font color="#008000" size="3">Don asked John to find more pairs
of numbers that add to 7, which he did, then plotted those on the graph. John
eventually followed the &quot;yellow brick road&quot; to get negatives (8+<sup>-</sup>1
is like 8 and a takeaway 1 = 7), and Don
put a mark at&nbsp; (4 1/2, 2 1/2). They talked about Don giving John 4 cookies

of Don's 3-D Multiplication Table on the floor. (Also on the floor were pieces

put the flat pieces in order. Originally sawed from a flat 10x10x1 piece of wood
from the Dienes Blocks set, each piece was marked as shown in the picture. They put
this on the table to show everyone. Everyone looked for patterns in the steps. They
saw the 2x-table going up to the right and left, then the 3-times table. Don
asked Hannah about the numbers going up the middle..they were 1, 4, 9, 16 which
were the square numbers. And that got Hannah working on square numbers above!</b></font></p>

We enjoyed it as well!  We will come again, we had a great time, we decided to just go home instead of going to Springfield, which we'll have to do next time. We'll be checking your
website and get back with you  when we need to set something up (instant

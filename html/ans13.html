Running this program fills in a 1x1 square; the number of dots varies 
with the calculator or computer. On my calculator I got 400 points. To 
change the program to plot the points under a parabola y = 
x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> from 0 to 1, replace the 1 in line 
5 with x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>. In the basic program 
change statement 20 from 81 to x<sup><font 
size=-2>2</font></sup>. I got the picture on the right and N=133. So 
the area under the curve y = x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> from 
0 to 1 was 133/400, very close to 1/3 = 133/399, which is the integral of 
x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>, from 0 to 1!!<br> Needless to say, 
this was very exciting. I showed it to everyone- teachers, students, and 
parents.<br> <b>4. Finding the area under curves on 
graph paper:</b> (From the scan of Sean's graph below I added the colors 
and some lines to make things more readable) <br> Matt, a 7 year old, 
counted the squares
under y = x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> from x = 0 to x = 1.
He counted 32 squares, and 32/100 of the 1 x 1 <font color=#0000ff>blue 
</font>square below as the 
area. Byron, 
a 10 year old recently doing this, counted 42 squares and I told him to go 
back and do it again and be more careful. He too came up with 32. I asked 
Matt what simple fraction was close to this. He said 1/3; I wrote this 
as 1/3*1*1<sup><font
size=-2>2</font></sup> or 1/3*1<sup><font
size=-2>3</font></sup>.<br> <center><img 
src="../images/sean7.gif" width="297" height="663"></center> 
<br> From 0 to 2 he correctly predicted 1/3 of the 2x2<sup><font 
size=-2>2</font></sup> rectangle or 1/3*2<sup><font
size=-2>3</font></sup> (the  <font color=#40FF6F>green</font> 
rectangle above) as the area under 
the curve y = x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup> from x = 0 to x = 
2.<br>Sean counted approximately 279 squares in going from 0 to 2, but 
was satisfied this was close enough. He figured there are 20*40 = 800 
little squares in the 2x4  <font color=#40FF6F>green</font> rectangle and 
the area should be 1/3 of 800 or 266.66... which is close to 279. The 
notation I used on his graph I now have changed to and use A<sub><font 
size=-2>0-1</font></sub> (x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>) = 
1/3*1<sup><font
size=-2>3</font></sup>. Then the area from 0-2 he wrote as A<sub><font
size=-2>0-2</font></sub> (x<sup><font size=-2>2</font></sup>) =
1/3*2<sup><font
size=-2>3</font></sup>. Writing the area this way instead of 1 and 8, 
makes it possible to see a pattern. I always want my students to look for 
patterns. Writing the answers different ways often helps to see the 
pattern. <p>What would you predict would be the area from 0-3? 0-4? 0-n?
<br> How about finding the area under the curve y = x<sup><font 
size=-1>3</sup></font> from 0-1? 0-2? 0-n?... Look for patterns!
<br><b>7. The logs</b><br>
<img align=left
src="../images/logscal.gif" width="140" height="252">
Notice  0.602 = 2*0.301 or log 4 = <font
color=#ff0000>2</font>*log<font color=#0000ff>
2</font> =  log<font color=#0000ff>
2</font><sup><font size=-1><font
color=#ff0000>2</font></sup></font> 



<br> and 0.903 = 3*0.301 <br> or log 8 = <font
color=#ff0000>3</font>*log<font color=#0000ff>
2</font> =  log<font color=#0000ff>
2</font><sup><font size=-1><font
color=#ff0000>3</font></sup></font> 

<br>Generalizing,<br> <font
color=#ff0000>a</font>*log<font color=#0000ff>
b</font> =  log<font color=#0000ff> 
b</font><sup><font size=-1><font 
color=#ff0000>a</font></sup></font>
<p>Some youngsters do the above first, some do the following 
first.<br>Notice also 0.301 + 0.477 = 0.778, which is<br>

log <font color=#ff0000>2</font> + log<font color=#0000ff> 
3</font> = log 6 = log (<font color=#ff0000>2</font>*<font 
color=#0000ff>3</font>)
<br>Test out more of these, then generalize.<p>How about this, log (1/ 
<font color=#ff0000>2</font>) =  <sup><b>-</b></sup> log  <font 
color=#ff0000>2</font>.<br> And log (1/4) = ? Can you generlize these 
statements?<br><center><font color=#FF40FF>PATTERNS ARE EVERYWHERE!!</FONT>

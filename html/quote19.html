Dear Mr. Cohen,<p>Thank you so much for the beautiful painting </p>
<p>&amp; for helping me so much with 
math! I love being </p>
<p>able to save my questions about my homework until </p>
<p>Saturday 
because I know that I will be able to understand </p>
<p>what I'm doing in class after I 
leave your house.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Love, E (a HS junior)</p>

&quot;Dear Don, Thank you for your rapid response. I will briefly introduce myself to 
you. I am a medical doctor, specialized in oncology. The Mathman website let me 
know your activity. And of course I have already read your two textbooks in 
Japanese. My child is 6 year old girl who is now learning at some international 
school.. She can speak both Japanese and English ..but she is neither a 
math-genius nor specially interested in numbers. She likes Disney Princesses 
very much. Anyway, I am very interested in your worksheet book because I hope to 
introduce mathematics to her through your Mathman strategy. I wish if she would 
participate at your homeschool during summer holidays in near future.- T.R., MD.

careless, but with your material I can find a way to change my mistake into a

font-family:Arial"><b><font color="#008000">I want my children to understand
that there's more to math than arithmetic, and that math is truly an art, not
just a 'get the right answer, please' subject. For much of math is not
coming up with one, correct answer; it is conceptual and interesting! However,
what a child attains in the way of mathematical understanding is directly
related to our expectations of what he can achieve. And the typical math
curriculum for younger children reveals much about our expectations. In fact,
when Don Cohen presents his program as appropriate for ages seven and up (yes,
seven and up), your initial reaction may be that it's just for the gifted. Not
so! Mark, at age seven, is ready for most of the concepts explored. In fact, the
videotapes are aimed at 6- to 11-year olds. Don's admonition to 'start
important math early' is well-grounded in his own experience with young
children, and advice we should consider. Young children are naturally fascinated
by the 'art' part of math. Iteration and infinite sequences, key concepts in
calculus, are delightful to contemplate for a naturally curious six-year-old.
Take this beginning example: start with a square, and keep filling in half of
the remaining portion (Don supplies a nice gridded square in the Worksheets to
illustrate this). Each time, cut the remaining section in half. You get smaller
and smaller 'leftovers', but you never fill it all in! Mark found this
fascinating, and had no trouble understanding the concept. I found the whole
idea behind Don's books and videos intriguing; concepts are presented in an
understandable and thought-provoking way, encouraging the student to use
hands-on exploration to 'discover' many concepts foundational to calculus.
It reminded me somewhat of Miquon, only with more involvement by the reader, and
is well suited to questioning minds of all ages. The heart of the course is a
small, wire-bound 'text', very brief and clear. Most of this material is
repeated, in more usable format for the investigator, in the thick Worksheets
book (it is not necessary to purchase both). Print is large, making it more
accessible to the young reader, and pages are uncluttered. Don truly has a knack
for presenting these ideas and explorations in a way that children quickly
become caught up and actively involved in deducing the principles he's leading
them to uncover. He teaches techniques of discovery that will improve their
ability to solve problems everyday, and not just in the area of math. In fact,
several of the explorations include more than a bit of science, as orderly
design is evident in creation. The chambered nautilus is studied, as are
pineapple leaves, sunflower stalks, light reflection, and a ratio of surface
area to volume of rods that leads to a discovery of why rats are nocturnal
animals! I got absorbed in the book immediately, pondering his follow-up
questions that take you past the immediate discovery, into uncharted waters!
Calculus By and For Young People is empowering for anyone who has natural
curiosity! As far as implementation, I would suggest using this course here and
there throughout elementary ages (perhaps during summer months), and certainly
before your student reaches calculus as a regular math course because it teaches
the concepts behind the numbers so much better than traditional calculus books.
Anyone who can read can be set loose with the Worksheets with no adult
intervention; younger children can benefit from the videos. The Infinite Series
video parallels chapter 1 in the text and would be a helpful for the teacher who
is not confident about this type of math instruction. The Iteration to Infinite
Sequences video parallels chapter 8. (Don, the 'Mathman', also teaches
workshops using his methods, and has a 'Math by Mail/Email' program.)&quot;</font></b><o:p>

 <font face="Arial" color="#000000" size="3">April 2003 From a parent in
 Canada:</font>
<FONT color=#800000> 
 Calculus By and For Young People-- Worksheets by Don Cohen is a book of
wonderfully visual worksheets which lead young people (and their parents ) into
the joy and science that is math at its best. Somewhere between kindergarten and
high school graduation the concept of math as a joyful, experimental science
disappeared for most of us. The drudgery of repetitious arithmetic with right
and wrong answers is NOT the approach taken in Cohen's book. My kids are
primarily visual learners who do math in a non linear fashion and suffer with
current school curriculum. The workbook's emphasis on ideas rather than methods
has supported their learning style and increased their confidence. The author
and the young students who work with him present calculus in a format which can
be (and is) followed by seven year olds, yet is clear and appealing to all ages.
The workbook has been designed by someone familiar with keen problem solvers, as
well as math phobes, or those who have become math shy as a result of the
standard right/wrong approach. Best of all parent input is rarely needed,
(speaking of calculus phobes). Each page deals with options for solving involved
calculus problems. You have to flip over the page to see the next step (which
helps with my sons who are speed readers and often read the solution before
mulling over the problem). All kinds of problem solving options are explored and
discussed, with an emphasis on pattern recognition and visual and practical
methods of examining calculus problems. Lots of examples share the ways other
people solved the problem and explain why they tried what they did in a truly
collaborative fashion. The book is designed to be used to work on observing
(creating) and solving problems. It is not a text or a curriculum based book. It
is a wonderful way to introduce any keen or math shy child to the joy of working
on and solving what appear to be difficult problems using examples from real
life. Despite the visual format there is a refreshing lack of cute characters or
sugary language. You don't need to be a math whiz kid to use this book. Basic
knowledge of math and a mind open to exploring are enough to get you in the door
and down the path (solving common physical puzzles like the shuttle puzzle and
the tower puzzle on your way). In a very nice touch, graph paper of different
sizes useful for physically and visually working out the problems, is included
in a format for copying at the back of the workbook. Highly recommended!</font></span></b></span><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="-1"><hr>

a Rainbow Resource catalog - the catalog had quite a good write-up on your

really like your gentle attitude about it being OK to make some mistakes and on
your video tape (we have only watched the first one) your love of your subject
is infectious - I don't think that my children had ever considered math to be
something you do because you like it (shame on their mother-me), but just
something you do until you get it right so you can go on to something that you
actually enjoy.</span></b><span style="color:green">&nbsp; I just put the first

discovered [in his cookie-sharing from Chapter 2], explains Don Cohen- a.k.a.
The Mathman, and author of this absorbing little book- is an infinite series.
From just such simple investigative beginnings, Cohen shepherds young (and
older) learners into the beauties and complexities of higher mathematics. Using
models, projects, puzzles, pictures, calculators, and self-written computer
programs, kids explore many of the classic problems of mathematics- how did
Archimedes figure out the area enclosed by a curve?- and discover the principles
of functions, integrals, slopes and derivatives, the secrets of the snowflake
curves, and the fascinations of the Fibonacci numbers. The book itself is tiny-
spiral bound, 3 3/4x5&quot; - but the concepts it encloses are immense. There's
an accompanying (and much larger) Worksheets book with [questions leading to the
concepts], additional problem suggestions, examples, and [student ]
illustrations, plus reproducible graph papers and a detailed bibliography.

in simple terms. I looked at the libraries, book stores and colleges for some
kind of workbook that would enable me to teach myself. One year, I bought &quot;Schaum's
Beginner's Calculus&quot; that included Don's brochure. I thought WOW! NEAT! I
needed to preview the book, though. Eventually after getting on the internet I
came across Don's web page. He had sample problems from each chapter on his web
sight. As I looked at each problem I thought, &quot;Anyone can do this!&quot; I
was sold. I got the book and went through it in about 2 weeks. Now I am enrolled
in a correspondence calculus course and my grade is 96%! Don's book helped me
understand the CONCEPTS better that any other workbook I have purchased. I also
gave the problems to my young relatives , the neighbor kids, any kid I can get
my hands on. They just love doing them. This book is great for people of all

they go through Don's worksheet book. It's a must have.&quot;<br>

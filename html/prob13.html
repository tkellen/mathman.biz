<b>Chapter 13</b>: Area Under Curves-- The Integral
<hr>
<b>1. Area on the geoboard.</b><br>
<img align="right" src="../images/geobd.gif" width="171" height="184"><br>
I start young people working on a geoboard. The geoboard I use is 1/2&quot;
plywood with a 5 by 5 square array of nails, about 2&quot; apart with about
1&quot; edge. I also have &quot;spotty&quot; paper, with dots the same distance
apart as the geoboard so that my younger students can draw the shapes. I also
have 1/2&quot; spotty paper for the older students.<br>
If it takes 1 can of paint to paint inside the square (figure A), how many cans
of paint does it take to fill in figures B, C, and D?<br>
There are many investigations one can get into: Make some shapes and find how
many cans of paint it takes to paint inside them (in other words, find the area
within each figure).<br>
How many segments can you make on this 5x5 geoboard?<br>
How many squares can you make on this 5x5 geoboard (no diagonal sides)?<br>
What is the area of each triangle below?<br>

<b>2. How Archimedes found the area within a parabolic segment</b> - Not shown
here.
<p><b>3. Plotting points on a computer or programmable calculator to find the
area under curves:</b>I was browsing through a <i>Scientific American</i>
&quot;Computer Recreations&quot; article in which they were filling in squares
on a computer screen. I asked myself &quot;Could I do that on our programmable
graphing calculator?&quot; After a couple of hours of trying things and making
mistakes (I was never good at programming), I was able to plot points on the
screen to make a square. Hoorah! I plotted points as in the figure at left below
to make a 1x1 square. <font color="#ff0000">If you count the number of points,
this number will be a measure of the area of the square!</font><br>
<center><img src="../images/myprog.gif" width="182" height="93"></center>The next thing I asked of
course was, could I find the area under a curve, say x<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>,
as in the figure above at the right.<br>
Write a program to plot points to make a square, then so it is possible to
change the upper level of the points. Can you predict the area under y = x<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>?<a href="ans13.html"><br>
Look at my program to plot the points.</a>
<p><b>4. Finding the area under curves on graph paper</b><img align="right" src="../images/ax20-2.gif" width="174" height="313"><br>
At this time I realized that not every youngster had a programmable, graphing
calculator. So I decided to use 1/10&quot; graph paper to do the same thing.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>First predict what part of the area of the 1x1 square at the right is under
the curve y = x<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>. Graph the curve y = x<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>
carefully from x =0 to 2 (use 10 squares for 1 unit). Count the squares under
the curve from 0 to 1, by approximating (carefully). Then count the the squares
in the 1x1 square. Find the ratio of the no. of squares under the curve from 0
to 1, to the no. of squares in th 1x1 square. What simple fraction is close to
this number?
<p>Now count the squares under the curve from 0 to 2. Notice that the area
surrounding the this part of the curve is not a square but a rectangle of 2*2<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>
= 8 = 2<sup><font size="-2">3</font></sup>. What fraction of this rectangle is
under the curve?
<p><b>5. The rectangle method (the standard textbook method) of finding the area
under curves.</b> - Not shown here.
<p><b>6. Two problems.</b> Two seemingly unrelated problems ended up with
similar interesting solutions!<br>
Problem 1. The area under the parabola y = x<sup><font size="-2">2</font></sup>,
from 0 to 1.<br>
Problem 2. The ratio of (the vol. of a square pyramid)<b>/</b>(the vol. of a
cube), with the same base.<br>
- this is not done here.<br>
<b>7. The natural logarithm is the area under a curve and an infinite series.</b><br>
Fill in the table below. <font color="#ff0000">Guess</font> the log 1 (read as
the log of 1, and to base 10), first, and put your guess in the table in the
right-hand column, <font color="#0000FF">even though you probably don't know
what a log is!</font> Then use a calculator to get the log 1, to 3 decimal
places- put that in the center column, under 'calculator answer'. Then guess
what the log 2 is. Put that number in the right-hand column. Use the clculator
to get the log 2 to 3 decimal places- put that under 'calculator answer'. Fill
in the rest of the table, and look for patterns as you go.

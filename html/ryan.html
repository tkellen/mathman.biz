<p align="left"><font size="3">In cutting up a 10x10 = 100 little squares to
share with 3 people, Ryan agreed that 1/3 = .33 1/3 = .333... Don asked what 2/3
= ? When Don showed him that 2/3 = 1/3 + 1/3, he said 2/3 = .666..., then 3/3 =
.999... just by adding,&nbsp; and 3/3 = 1 = .999... Then to Don's surprise he
wrote 4/3 = .121212... He explained his work: &quot;I added 1/3 + 3/3 =&nbsp;
.333... + .999... = .121212... because 3 + 9 = 12&quot;. Don told Ryan he had a
good idea, and is correct enough that Don understand what he did, but the answer
has to be 1 + something, because 4/3 &gt; 1. So it should be 1. something, and
the one's (the carry-overs ), are added to the 2's to get 3's. So we get 4/3 =
1.333... Then he wrote 5/3 = 1.515151... and he fixed this to 1.666... So in the
end, it is a case of adding 6 tenths and 9 tenths to get 15 tenths which is 1
and 5 tenths. Then 6 hundredths and 9 hundredths to get 15 hundredths which is 1
tenth and 5 hundredth. and we add the 1 tenth to the 5 tenths to get 6 tenths
and so on, to get 1.666.. = 5/3. <b>Or</b>&nbsp; 5/3 = 3/3 + 2/3 = 1 + .666...=
1.666...</font></p>

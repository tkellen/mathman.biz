<p align="left"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Don asked Kelda, a 7th grader,
to make rectangles of perimeter 20. she made these.</font></b></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/per20rects.jpg" width="588" height="471"></p>
<p align="left">Then she graphed the Length vs Width of the rectangles and found
an equation for this straight line graph below, to be 10-L=W or 10-W=L or as Don
added L+W=10. Don missed the chance to talk about the slope of this graph is (<sup>-</sup>1),
and the y-intercept is 10. We'll talk about this next time.</p>

<p align="left">Then Kelda graphed the Length vs the Area of the rectangles:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/per20LvsA.jpg" width="464" height="641"></p>
<p align="left">Kelda knew that the area of a rectangle is A = L* W; he asked
her to find an equation for the graph above. She knew the equation relating the
width to the length was 10-L= w, so Don suggested she substitute 10-L&nbsp; for
W in the Area equation. She did this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/per20eqA=.jpg" width="245" height="222"></p>
<p align="left">The equation of the L vs A graph she found was A = 10L - L<font size="2"><b><sup>2</sup>
. </b></font><font size="3">They talked about the graph being a parabola and if </font>L<font size="2"><b><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></b></font><font size="3">
is</font><b><font size="2"> </font></b><font size="3">negative as in this case,
the curve opens downward. The largest area was 25, which was a square. For a
given perimeter, the rectangle which is a square has the largest area. (Is there
a curve that would have a larger area with a perimeter of 20?) Don used his
pencil to show the slope of the parabola was changing and was zero at the
maximum point. This is an example of the fact that when the derivative of a
function, or the slope of the tangent, is zero, the function or curve has a
maximum (or minimum) point- important in calculus. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">[</font><font size="3">If we take the derivative
of </font>10L - L<font size="2"><b><sup>2 </sup></b></font><font size="3"> we
get 10-2L, set this equal to 0, we get 10-2L=0 and L=5. This is the length of
the rectangle (5) with the maximum area of A = </font>10L - L<font size="2"><b><sup>2</sup></b>,</font><font size="3">
with 5-&gt;L, the maximum A=</font><b><sup><font size="2"> </font></sup></b><font size="3">10*5
- 5</font><font size="2"><b><sup>2</sup></b> = </font><font size="3">25 (which
we knew before, without taking the derivative!)]. <font color="#FF00FF">Intuition
is important!</font></font></p>

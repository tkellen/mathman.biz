<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hi Tom,<br>
<br>
Sorry to be so long in answering.<br>
<br>
Debbie, a teacher in Keokuk IA, back about 6 years ago, worked with 6-8th
graders in my worksheet book. She did something I wouldn't do, but it worked for
her. Every child worked on chapter 1 for about 4 months. They all made the
diagrams (see the answer page to chapter 1 sample problems), in color, for 1/2 +
1/4 + ..., found the partial sums, graphed the partial sums, talked about what
was happening. Then they went to 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... and did the same thing.
They generalized 1/n + (1/n)^2 + (1/n)^3 + ... then did 2/5 + (2/5)^2 + ...,
generalizing to A/B + (A/B)^2 + (A/B)^3 + ... -&gt;&nbsp; A/(B-A). That was
impressive.&nbsp; Two of her students found errors in chapter 4 when working on
the snowflake and Serpinski curves. She raised money for me to spend a day at
her school and work with her students.<br>
<br>
Now, Tom, I work with individual students in groups of about 5 (the ideal
situation- The Math Program, which we have been doing for 27 years!). I wouldn't
do it that way. I would get one or two youngsters working on chapter 1, some on
chapter 6 (functions and graphs), some on chapter 8 (solving equations). You
might want to break down chapters, like<br>
<br>
Chapter 1<br>
1. add 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... in color<br>
2. find partial sums for at least 6 terms<br>
3. graph the partial sums<br>
4. determine where the sum is going (the limit)<br>
5. does it make sense so far? what's happening as one goes along in each step
above? What patterns do you see? Can you predict the next 3 terms?<br>
<br>
Then do these 5 steps for 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 +...<br>
Then do these 5 steps for 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 +... and so on.<br>
<br>
See my problem is Tom, I can't do the same thing twice. I like variation and
chaos! I want kids to do things in ways I haven't seen. Then I enjoy my
teaching, when I learn new things. See my student's works in &quot;New
Discoveries&quot;. Of course, most of the work I have done and written about is
from the kids.<br>
<br>
Lastly, start some kids going and YOU and THEY will enjoy it. You can talk to
the kids about what they are doing, questions they have. I don't use my
worksheet book except for one student who comes just for that. She comes once a
week for 45 minutes and loves it.<br>
<br>
It took me a long time to be able to do this off the top of my head. I spent
many, many hours writing down what are the <a href="/html/whatmath.html">important
ideas in mathematics</a>. I taught 6 years in junior high schools. I knew what I
was doing was good but the organization of the school and I didn't 'click'. I
then had a great teacher in Robert B. Davis, with whom I worked with for about
15 years. Then I worked on computer-based education for 4 years. Then my partner
and I started The Math Program. This organization for teaching enabled us to
work with students of all ages and abilities, in small groups. Parents pay us,
so if the kids don't do better in school, we are not doing our job, and will not
get paid! We've been doing this for 27 years, so we are doing most things right.<br>
<br>
I hope this has been helpful, Tom. <b>Please let me know what you do and what
the kids do</b>. If they do something interesting, perhaps I will put it on my
New Discoveries page! Good luck. Fear not, the kids will help. And HAVE FUN!<br>
<br>
Cordially, Don</font></p>

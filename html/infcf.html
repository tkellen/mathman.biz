Get an infinite continued fraction and find approximations.<br> We can
take this function <sup><img
align=middle src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28"> </sup>and in place of x we'll put 
<sup><img
align=middle src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28"></sup>, since this is equal to x and
<p>&nbsp;we
get <sub><sub><img src="../images/556x.gif" width="56" height="36"></sub></sub>. Then we'll put
<sup><img align=middle
src="../images/56x.gif" width="38" height="28"> </sup>in for x again, and we get <img 
align=middle
src="../images/5556x.gif" width="99" height="63">. If we keep doing that we get this <b>infinite
continued fraction</b>. Jonathan, at age 7, did this at home with his 
Mom. He got all excited about this being infinite! <br>If you put 1 in the 
first of these you get <sup>-</sup>1. If you put 1 in the second one you get 11. If 
you put 1 in for x in the third one you get 4.4545.. You get an infinite 
sequence which approaches 3, which is one of the two roots of the 
equation. <br> If you start with -100, you would still get an infinite sequence approaching 3 as well. Notice, you only get the one root, 3, using method 2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sample Problems from Chapter 2</h2>
</center><b>Chapter 2</b>: Brad's: Share 6 cookies With 7 People
<h3>This starts with such a simple idea, gets into important mathematics
(division, sharing, fractions, infinite series), and most young people can and <u>should</u>
do it!</h3>
<b>1).</b> Share 2 cookies between 3 people. How many does each person get? <b>Each
person must get the same amount</b>, and you can't give any to the dog (you must
use all the cookies). Use blank 3&quot;x5&quot; cards for the cookies (not
circles!) and scissors to cut them.
<p><b>2).</b> Same problem: share 2 cookies between 3 people, but <font color="#ff0000">this
time use Brad's method</font>. Brad had finished 2nd grade. He shared the pieces
when he could, then cut each leftover piece into 2 equal pieces! Like your
scissors are special, they can only cut into 2 equal pieces. Share the pieces
when you can, then cut. Keep track of how much each person gets, even when they
get zero of a certain size piece!
<p><b>3).</b> Try other problems like share 1 cookie with 5 people, 2 cookies
with 5 people and so forth, use Brad's method and <font color="#0000ff">look for
patterns!</font>
<p><b>4). </b>Write a computer program for Brad's method that will give the
bimal, that is, get the numerators only (the denominators will be powers of 2)
of the resultant infinite series for sharing T cookies with B people.

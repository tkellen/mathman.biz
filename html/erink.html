<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial">&quot;One day I tried to figure out an algebra problem that said
2x + 3 = 18. I tried 8 but that was too big and 7 was too small.&nbsp;<i> </i>I<i>
</i>drew a number line&nbsp; --<font size="1">7</font>---------<font size="1">8</font>--
. <font color="#800000">But
I did not know that there was a number between 7 &amp; 8, but then I thought of
7 1/2.</font>&nbsp; So I tried it and it worked! That gave me an idea: I wanted to see
how many numbers I could find between 7 &amp; 8. I found 29 of them and they
are: 7 1/2, 7 3/7, 7 9/10, 7 4/10, 7 3/9,&nbsp; 7 8/9, 7 5/6, 7 2/9, 7 3/4, 7
3/6, 7 2/9, 7 6/9, 74/9, 7 5/9, 7 1/3, 7 1/4, 7 1/5, 7 1/6, 7 1/7, 7 1/8, 7 1/9,
7 2/32, 7 6/8, 7 4/6, 7 6/10, 7 4/5, 7 2/11, 7 3/5, 7 5/8&quot;.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000">Erin decided right away that if she couldn't
share, she would cut the remaining pieces into 2 equal pieces [a common and
simple way of solving a problem like this]. Erin &amp; Don discussed how many of
each piece would make a whole cookie, then she could name that piece. [See the
sample problems for chapter 2].&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#008000"><b>Don looked at what Erin did and was really
confused. What Erin did was to take 1/3 of the 9x9 square (orange piece); that
was fine. Then instead of adding 1/3 of 1/3, she added 1/3 of what was left!!!
The red part was 1/3 of 2/3 = 18/81 = 2/9 of the big square. Don asked Erin to
keep going using her method and see what was going to happen. Meanwhile Don proceeded to continue her method by himself,
to obtain the interesting result.</b></font></p>

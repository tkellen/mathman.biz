summer have still stuck with me...<br>

about her beginning at NM where she is studying Architecture. Sarah came the
second summer with Don, this time to prepare for her pre-calc class. Sarah told
her Mom, &quot;I got a B+ on my first test. When the instructor was returning
the tests he told me most of the class flunked this test. I would never have
done it without my work with Mr. Cohen this summer. I knew what I was doing
right away!&quot;</font><font face="Arial"> </font>

Olivia's work</a> on the Soma cube), my eleven-year-old and on Anna, my ten-year old. He has
helped Anna to become comfortable with math and has encouraged her need to be
able to visualize and understand by herself certain basic math principles&nbsp;
which we are often taught simply to take for granted. For example, she
questioned the rule that the three angles of a triangle always add up to 180<b>'</b>.
She drew very large triangles and very tiny triangles before beginning to
acknowledge what most of us easily accept. I sense a new confidence in her. <a href="anna.html">See

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">&quot;Mr. Cohen,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">Greetings from Ohio! I've always meant to
keep in touch but time seems to slip by. Now that I'm ready to graduate I
thought I'd drop you a line to tell you how much I appreciate&nbsp; the few
years I got to work with you in The Math Program. You instilled a love for math
in me that was able to get me through many hours of boring high school math.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">I will be graduating June 5th as
valedictorian of my class. Through the Academy Program offered by the state of
Ohio, I was able to attend the local branch of Ohio State my junior and senior
years and will graduate with 65 hours of college credit.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">I am a National Merit Finalist and attending
Ohio State Honors Program on a full academic scholarship.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Arial">Even though my math teachers tried to put me
down for my odd ways of performing math, I managed a 790 on my math SAT&nbsp;
and am planning on majoring in both math and psychology.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">I've always regretted having to move away
from your program, but what you gave me really helped mold who I am today. Many
thanks. I'm sure our paths will cross some day. Thanks for your inspiration,

<p><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">June 1998: &quot;Until a year
ago, my son had always struggled with math.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The traditional way math was being taught to him in school didn't seem
to click with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to get
the correct answer, he would break the figures down in a different way than that
of his fellow students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every time
they were given a test in math everybody else would be turning the page while my
son was still working on problems on the first page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would then become evident to him that he was not keeping up with the
rest of the class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He felt as
though he was stupid in math even though he excelled in the other subjects.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>The
national standard achievement tests would show that he had advanced math skills
in geometry and yet he was failing basic math.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His frustration was growing as he seemed to be sitting still as far as
receiving an education went.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>I
didn't know what to do or where to turn for help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My girlfriend suggested The Math Program and Don Cohen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It seemed her daughter had the same problem about fifteen years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She attended The Math Program and is now a teacher herself.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>My
son and I met with Mr. Cohen and I signed him up for a summer session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly after that my son's life completely turned around!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He came home from the first class excited and couldn't wait to go back
to the next class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Math was finally
being taught to him in a way that he could understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It only got better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
constantly talked about math and wanted to show everyone who would listen what
he was learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was amazing to
me that what he had hated not very long ago, he now loved.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">After two
summers in The Math Program, my son now lives and breathes math.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He is a freshman in high school and is taking geometry, which just
happens to be his favorite subject this year.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#CC33FF" face="Arial" size="4">His math of
choice is trigonometry, which he also learned from Mr. Cohen, along with
Calculus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His aspirations have
changed slightly since he met Mr. Cohen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
wanted to be a computer engineer, but now plans to get a PHD in computer science
along with a PHD in calculus and physics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That's
quite an attitude change for someone who was lost in the system and just about
fell through the cracks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
goodness there is another option and that is The Math Program!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#CC33FF">From
grade schoolers through adults, everyone needs to believe in him or herself and
have great expectations.</font> <font color="#CC33FF">My son now says, 'I can
do anything I want to do', because he knows 'math is power'.</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#CC33FF">Many,
many thanks Mr. Cohen for taking my sons' life in a new direction&quot;.</font>

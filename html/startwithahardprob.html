<p align="left">From a parent whose 2 children came to work with Don for a 
number of years- a great description of Don's teaching:<br>
<br>
&quot;Typical approach studies one simple concept at a time- boring- isolated, 
irrelevant. Instead- have a more interesting, complicated problem, that uses 
these concepts in finding the answer. This leads the student through math 
concepts, seeing them in their natural context and usefulness. Also, when the 
problem is finally solved, the 'Look what I can do!' feeling spurs further 
exploration of math.&quot;</p>

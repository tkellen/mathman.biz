<p align="left">Ratan worked on the Tower Puzzle and got the rule 2<sup>x</sup> 
- 1 =&nbsp; y. He then graphed this function (in black). Don suggested he find 
the inverse of ths function by switching the x and y coordinates to get the 
orange curve. Then Don suggested he graph y = x which is the blue graph.<body>

They talked about the inverse and how it was the mirror image of the original 
curve and that he could write the equation

<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Toshio, age 9 &amp; Reiko, just 8, worked
with Don for 6 days</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Day 1</font><font size="3">: Sunday&nbsp; July 29, 2001:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">Some background: <font color="#008000"><b>Toshio</b></font>
&amp; <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font>'s parents spent about an hour
talking with Don about how he came to this point in his life. They had purchased
his Japanese books, CD-Rom and all his materials in English, while in Japan.
They read his books over and over. They came to the US in September and are here
for 2 years while Dad is working in NM. They thought enough of Don's material
and his way of teaching, that they wanted Toshio, a bright young man of 9, to
work with him. Don thought just Toshio would be coming with his Dad to
Champaign. It turned out that the whole family came. Reiko is a bright young
lady, just 8. Working with Toshio for 2 minutes, and realizing that Reiko was
doing some things along with him, Don and their parents decided that Don should
also work with Reiko. Mom was needed to translate quite a bit and she did a
marvelous job, throughout the week.
<hr>
</font><font size="3">After a couple of cases, Don saw that <b><font color="#008000">Toshio</font></b>
knew what squaring a number meant, and he knew that 4 - 5 = <sup>-</sup>1. Don
knew that Toshio could solve a quadratic equation by guessing. Don had him give
a small number to try... see <a href="/html/prob8.html">solving
quadratic equations</a> in ch. 8. After the first 2 equations, Toshio realised
the secrets, and successfully solved the following:</font>
<p align="center">x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp;
,&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 10 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> - 9x + 14 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> - 10x + 24 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp;
,&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> - 11x + 24 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;
{&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup>
- 25x + 24 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp; {&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; } and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<sup>2</sup> - 6 1/2 x + 9 = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;
{&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<p align="left">There was much discussion of what patterns he saw with the 2
answers and the numbers in the equation, what numbers multiply to give 24, and
adding 2 numbers to get 6 1/2. Then Don asked Toshio to make up a problem for
Don and his Mom. He did this well, and his Mom got the answers to her equation
quickly!</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000">Toshio</font> worked on the<a href="/html/prob6.html">
Shuttle Puzzle</a>, which he found difficult (not unusual). As Don worked with
Toshio and Reiko, he would describe for Mom and Dad what he was trying to do and
the features of how he did it. For example, when Toshio was having trouble with
4 pairs of pegs on the Shuttle Puzzle, the hard problem, Don suggested he start
with 1 pair, an easier problem, then work up to the harder problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><b>Toshio</b></font> put the <a href="/html/3Dmultables.html">3D
Multiplication stack</a> in order and Toshio &amp; Mom found patterns on it. Don
showed both Toshio and Reiko how to play the <a href="/html/sherimagic.html">The
Magic Number game</a>.</p>
<hr>
Don started <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> off with the equation 2x +
3 = 17 to solve (<a href="prob8.html">see ch. 8</a>). After just a little
discussion about what this meant..find a number for x, such that when you double
it, then add 3, you get 17. She was able to find that 7 worked, that 7 made the
sentence true. Then Don gave her 2x + 3 = 18. Reiko did a couple of interesting
things: She first changed the equation to 3x + 3 = 18, and which she knew the
answer this equation was 5. Don called her &quot;a wise guy&quot;, and had to
explain to Mom what that figure of speech meant in English. It was fascinating
to work with them. They didn't always know what Don meant, but Mom would save
the day, by translating not only what Don said, but on Don's insistence, she
would try to explain what she thought the children were thinking about! (This
brings to mind that one of Don's students once told him, &quot;There is this
movie 'Stand and Deliver', you 'Sit and Listen'!). Reiko then changed the
equation to 2x + 3 = 17, which she had already solved! They went back to 2x + 3
= 18, and talked about 7 was too small and 8 was too big and what could it be.
Don used <a href="/html/ans2.html">cookie-sharing</a>
(3&quot;x5&quot; cards) to get her to realize that there is a number between 7
and 8 (in fact an infinite number of them!). She tried 7 1/2. What does 2 x 7
1/2 mean?... And it worked.
<p align="left">Reiko also worked on the <a href="/html/prob6.html">Tower
Puzzle</a> and the Magic Number Game.
<hr>
<b><font size="4">Day 2</font><font size="3">: Monday&nbsp; July 30, 2001:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#008000">Toshio</font></b> worked on the infinite series 1/2
+ 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ... by <a href="ans1.html">coloring
in the square</a> (ch.1). He found the partial sums. They talked about if these
partial sums were increasing, decreasing or staying the same and what was
happening.</p>
<p>Toshio worked on the Shuttle Puzzle and made a table of number pairs, x -
being the number of pairs of pegs and y-being the number of moves to interchange
them. He figured out that the y-numbers were going up by 2. And Don asked him to
think about the number of moves it would take to interchange 100 pairs of pegs!
In other words, find a rule to get from x to y, without having to go up to the
99th y-number.</p>
<p>Toshio and <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> each made a set of the 5
cards for the Magic Number Game to take back to NM with them. They also each
made a set of the <a href="olivia.html">Soma cube pieces</a> by gluing the
1 cm<sup>3</sup> blocks together. Reiko also glued others together to make other
shapes, not part of the Soma set.</p>
<p>Don had<font color="#FF00FF"><b> Reiko </b></font>make a graph of x + y = 7
(she was still 7 at that time). After talking about negative numbers on the
number line, Reiko found&nbsp; the point (8, <sup>-</sup>1) by Don's directions
to follow &quot;the yellow brick road&quot;,&nbsp; and she understood&nbsp; that
8 + <sup>-</sup>1 = 7. Don talked to Mom about &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;
movie which they had seen, and his reference to &quot;the yellow brick
road&quot;. Don had<b><font color="#FF00FF"> </font></b>Reiko<b><font color="#FF00FF">
</font></b>make a graph of x + y = 5 on the same graph paper:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/rekxy7.jpg" width="695" height="853"><br>
Everyday they each took something back to the hotel to work on. This day they
took the Tower Puzzle and the Shuttle Puzzle.
<hr>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4">Day 3</font><font size="3">: Tuesday&nbsp;
July 31, 2001:</font></b>
<p align="left"><br>
<b><font color="#008000">Toshio</font></b> graphed the partial sums of the
infinite series 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 15/16,...<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/toshpartsum.jpg" width="692" height="947"></p>
<p>Don used <i>Derive5</i> with Toshio to take the sum out to100 terms, 1/2 +
1/2<sup>2</sup> + 1/2<sup>3</sup> + 1/2<sup>4</sup> + 1/2<sup>5</sup> +..
+&nbsp; 1/2<sup>100 </sup>. Notice Toshio copied the answer as a fraction and as
a decimal. Don and Toshio talked about the fraction, and the patterns. He said
the top number was 1 less than the bottom number, just like the ones he had
figured out. And the decimal showed that the number was VERY, VERY close to 1 as
showed up on his graph above. They agreed the sum <font color="#FF00FF"><b>goes
to</b></font> 1.</p>
<p><b><font color="#008000">Both</font></b> <font color="#008000"><b>Toshio and </b></font><b><font color="#008000">Reiko
</font></b><font color="#008000"><b>showed a lot of the persistence with
everything they did. They worked very hard and always asked for more.</b></font></p>
<p>Toshio also worked on exponents and negative exponents with bases 2, 5, and
10. He ended up solving equations like 10<sup>3</sup> X 10<sup>x</sup> = 10<sup>7
</sup>. And he worked on the metal puzzles.
<hr>
Don asked <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> how the graphs of x + y = 7
and x + y = 5 were different and the same. She said the lines were parallel! And
they were 2 spaces apart.
<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> graphed x - y = 2:</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="../images/rekxy2.jpg" width="696" height="783"><br>
Reiko and her Mom had a long discussion about 1 - <sup>-</sup>1= 2. When Don
came over to join in, he first showed them that the point (1, <sup>-</sup>1)
indeed was on &quot;the yellow brick road&quot;, so 1 - <sup>-</sup>1 = 2. Then
he showed on a number line, if you have 1-1 you go down 1 from 1 to get to 0. If
you want 1 - <sup>-</sup>1 you have to change direction and start at 1 and go
back up 1 to get to 2. Then Don showed Reiko and Mom this pattern:</p>
<p align="left">In the examples below, the 1 stays the same, and as the second
number goes <font color="#FF0000">down</font> 1, the answer goes <font color="#0000FF">up</font>1<br>
1 - 3 = <sup>-</sup>2<br>
1 - 2 = <sup>-</sup>1<br>
1 - 0 = 1 so<br>
1 - <sup>-</sup>1= 2</p>
<p align="left">Reiko did something I had never seen a 7 year old do, she
changed the signs from 1 - <sup>-</sup>1 = 2&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1 + <sup>+</sup>1
= 2. WOW! Then the others were just as simple to her.</p>
<p align="left">Don saw on Mom's paper 1 - (-1) = 2. They&nbsp; talked about the
raised sign of the negative numbers like <sup>-</sup>1, and how it makes writing
sentences simpler. Even in today's math texts you can find 1 - (-1) = 2; if one
wrote it 1 - <sup>-</sup>1 = 2, there is no need for the parentheses and it is
much simpler. Reiko had the identity that if you subtract a number, just add its
opposite. A - B = A + <sup>-</sup>B. If B = <sup>-</sup>1, the opposite of&nbsp;
<sup>-</sup>1 is <sup>+</sup>1.</p>
<p align="left">Don put a point on her graph x + y = 7 in-between two points,
like (2 1/2, 4 1/2). She found the two numbers and added them to check if these
points worked, like 2 1/2 +&nbsp; 4 1/2 = 7, and they did!</p>
<p align="left">Don gave Reiko multiplications like 2x3= 6 she knew, then 2x30=
, 2x300 = , 2x3000= , 2x3000000 = , 2x3A = , 2x 3/7 = , 2x 3 sin <font face="Forte">x
</font><font face="Arial">= , 2x </font><sup>-</sup>3 =&nbsp; . After she did
these all correctly, the first time, he asked her to make up some like these.
The first one she made up was 500000000x 1 1/2= 700000000 1/2 she wrote. Don
thought that was very good and he understood it, but showed Reiko it should be
written 7 1/2 00000000 (7 1/2 hundred million). Later Don thought he should also
have written this as 700000000+ 1/200000000 = 700000000 + 50000000 = 750000000.
But he never got that to Reiko.</p>
<p align="left">About this time, Don showed Reiko how to scan her pictures. She
was then able to do that quite easily and enjoyed doing it!</p>
<p align="left">Reiko worked on the geoboard. After showing her what 1 can of
paint covered, or in other words, what an area of 1 looked like (within the
square below), she made other shapes and found the area within them. These had
an area of 1 (except for the 1/2 in the upper left corner below).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/rek1.jpg" width="371" height="290">.</p>
<p align="left">Then Don asked her about the area of these triangles below (with
a base of 1 and height 2). After some discussion of different ways to get the
area, she found these all had an area of 1:</p>
<br>
<img align="center" src="../images/rektr1.jpg" width="478" height="254"><br>
This day they took the metal puzzles back to the hotel (signing them out on
Don's sign-out sheet).
<hr>
<font size="4">Day 4</font><font size="3">:<b> Wednesday&nbsp; August 1, 2001</b>:</font><br>
Don made notes on a card about what <font color="#008000"><b>Toshio</b></font>
and <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> could work on each day. He kept
the card in his shirt pocket. Don tries to get them to ask questions, make up
new problems. When they wanted something else to do, they sometimes came up to
Don and said &quot;What do I do next?&quot;. Reiko started taking the card out
of Don's pocket to help him decide what they should do next! This is what makes
teaching so much fun!
<p>Don had the bubble water out for his students this day (see <a href="/html/bubbles.html">math
from Bubbles</a>). They looked at the bubbles made in cube and tetrahedron.
Later <font color="#008000"><b>Toshio </b></font>started making the cube using
wire and pliers. He finished it on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don had<font color="#008000"> <b>Toshio </b></font>graph 2x + 3 = y, and look
for patterns. He could&nbsp; predict where new points would go, what the change
to 5x + 3 =y would look like and how it would be different from the graph of 2x
+ 3 = y. Then Don had him find the equations for 3 graphs Don made. They talked
about the slope of the graph and the adding number as where it crossed the
y-axis.</p>
<p>Toshio started the infinite series 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + .. + 1/243... and they
talked about what simple fraction 40/81 was close to. This carried over to
Thursday. Mom asked about drawing the picture using the <a href="/html/infser.html">triangle</a>.
Don tends to let them color in the squares the way they can understand it best.
Don will try to have some youngsters do it this way!</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> shared 5 cookies between 3 people
and each person got 1 2/3 (She cut the 2 cookies that were left into thirds, and
each person got 2/3). Then Don gave her a different pair of scissors and told
her she had to do the same problem, but the scissors were special, they only cut
into 2 equal pieces. She then shared the 5 cookies between 3 people and each
person got 1 + 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8 + 0/16 + 1/32 + 0/64 + 1/128 + 0/256 + 1/512 +
0/1024 + 1/2048 + 0/4096 + ... and this infinite series equals 1 2/3. Of course
Reiko saw the patterns to get the bottom numbers, as adding the same number; to
get the tops, just alternate 1,0,1,0,1,0,... So 1 2/3 = 1 + 1/2 + 0/4 + 1/8 +
0/16 + 1/32 + 0/64 + 1/128 + 0/256 + 1/512 + 0/1024 + 1/2048 + 0/4096 + ...</p>
<p>Don had Reiko do division problems, how many 2's make 6? count by 2's
.....2,4,6, oh, 3.. Don wrote them going down and Reiko answered them.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/rekodiv.gif" width="201" height="266"></p>
<p align="left">After Don helped with the second one, Reiko was able to do these
correctly by herself, with only how many 2's in 64 a slight problem.</p>
<p align="left">Toshio,&nbsp; Reiko and Mom watched the video &quot;Strega
Nona&quot; upstairs. <img align="middle" src="../images/streganona.jpg" width="162" height="113">Reiko
found the Strega Nona doll that Mrs. Cohen had there. This video was made by
Weston Woods Studios, animated in Hungary. Don let them borrow 5 tapes: &quot;Strega
Nona&quot; +, &quot;Really Rosie&quot; by Maurice Sendak , &quot;Homer
Price&quot; (&quot;The Doughnut Machine&quot; +), and &quot;What's Under My
Bed?&quot; (&quot;The Three Robbers&quot;+). These were tapes Don took to his
grandchildren's Montessori Pre-School for their birthdays. He also let Mom
borrow a&nbsp; PBS tape of Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman's
career and death. They took these home. Don had described to Mom, Feynman's
lecture about making a theory...he said the first thing one needs to do is <font color="#FF0000"><b>GUESS
</b></font>what it should be. His students giggled at this, but this was very
important he said. Then one had to test out the theory, do some experiments, and
if it didn't work throw it away! So when Don has his students guessing to solve
equations, he feels confident that he is going in the right direction.</p>
<hr>
<b><font size="4">Day 5</font><font size="3">: Thursday&nbsp; August&nbsp; 2,
2001:</font></b>
<p>Don had <font color="#008000"><b>Toshio</b></font> start the graph of the
partial sums of the infinite series 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + 1/81 + .., and it was
left for him to finish it when he returned home. He spent a lot of time
finishing the wire cube that he was going to use in the bubble water.</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Reiko</b></font> worked on the infinite series
below:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/rekinfser.jpg" width="494" height="703"></p>
<p>Reiko made an M.C. Escher Kaleidocycle, with Don's help.</p>
<p>At dinner that night Don played &quot;Sprouts&quot; with Toshio and Reiko.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="4">Day 6</font><font size="3">: Friday&nbsp; August 3, 2001:</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3">After a breakfast birthday party for Reiko at Don's house,
Reiko, Toshio and Mom opened presents. Then they went downstairs to work on
math. Don worked with both of them, on multiplying numbers like 12x13 in their
head using squares and strips. Before the session was over, Toshio was
multiplying 22x23 in his head!</font></p>
<p><font size="3">This was a very exciting 6 days in Don's life. Despite the
language differences, Mom did such a fine job of translating, that Don found he
was working with these children as if they spoke English, just as if he was
working with the other, local children that were there most of the sessions.
Reiko and Toshio's Mom wrote these words: &quot;..Toshio and Reiko will treasure
their wonderful experiences with Don..These six days have flown by. They say
that they would like to come back to you again if they have a chance. I'm very
happy to hear that...&quot;</font></p>
<p>Don's favorite Japanese word was &quot;wakata?&quot; which means &quot;do you
understand?&quot;. Now he has added that to &quot;comprende?&quot; and &quot;capiece?&quot;
in Spanish and Italian, that he uses.</p>

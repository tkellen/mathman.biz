<p align="left">An example of a shape that I made on a geoboard is the pentagon
below. It has 2 nails<br>
inside not touching the rubberband (called i), and 8 nails touching the
rubberband (called n). The area was 5.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Irisageoboard.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p align="left">I made different shapes with a different number of nails inside each
time on the geoboard. I did it with 1, 2, and 3 nails inside. Then I had to calculate the area on a graph and
found a formula for how to figure out the
area for each shape by calculating number of nail touching (n).</p>

<p align="left">
For the 1 nail inside (i=1), I got the area calculation formula as ½n (½ of the number of nails touching). For the 2 nails
inside (i=2), I got ½n+1, and for the 3
nails inside (i=3), I got as ½n+2. I noticed that the more nails inside, the more you add to ½n. After that I made a guess for 4 nails inside. The guess I made was
½n+3.</p>

<p align="left">
Next I had to find the area with i (nails inside) in the formula. I got ½n* i-1 the first time but it was incorrect so I tried again. I got
<b><font size="4">A = ½n + i - 1</font></b> which is correct. For the formula, I always had to add or subtract to ½n to get
the correct area calculation. The pattern on the graph for the area was a straight line no
matter how many nails were inside or how many nails were touching.</p>

<p align="left">Then Mr. Cohen got out the 3D graphing board and I graphed <b><font size="4">A
= ½n + i - 1. </font></b><font size="3">n was like the x-axis, i was like the
y-axis, and A came up like the z-axis. The rubberbands tied around the top of
the rods where the plotted points. Can you see the patterns in this graph?</font></p>

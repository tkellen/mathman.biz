Hi Don!
<br>I'm doing fine. School ended about three weeks ago. I'm going into 8th
grade.&nbsp;I am currently attending the U of C Young Scholars Program. We're
learning geometry. Right now, I'm working on groups, subgroups, and
polyominoes.<p>

At home, I'm learning Advanced Algebra. I come across many problems that are
related to the questions in your worksheet book so I use the book as a reference tool.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Bye, Grace (about 2 years after Don started working with Grace!)<hr>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">1.</font><font size="5"> </font><font size="4">8/28/01</font><font size="3">
After they were unable to come to Champaign , Grace's Mom contacted Don to start
Grace working with him in his worksheet book. They had purchased his materials
in 1999 and Grace had started Ch. 1. Don talked with Grace using AIM; they
couldn't get the sound working yet, but went back and forth with the
typing.&nbsp; Grace had gotten the correct sum of 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32
= 31/32. Don asked her to look at the partial sums 1/2, 3/4, 7/8, 16/16, 31/32
for patterns. Were these numbers getting bigger, smaller or the same? She
correctly said they were getting bigger. Would the sum ever get to 2? 1? He
asked her&nbsp; to graph the partial sums like on p. 12 in his worksheet book.
Then Don recommend she also do some graphing, as in Ch. 6,&nbsp; 2x+3=y&nbsp;
and solve some equations as in ch. 8. Grace was really surprised that she could
skip chapters!</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">2.</font><font size="4"> 8/29/01 </font><font size="3">Mom
emailed Don Grace's graphs, here is one:</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.mathman.biz/images/grace/gracegr1wr.JPG" width="750" height="1106"></p>
<p align="left">Grace had the right sum, but her graph didn't work, because her
scale on the vertical axis was incorrect. Her new graph of the partial sums for
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +... was correct.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.mathman.biz/images/grace/gracep12.jpg" width="373" height="433"></p>
<p align="left">The other graphs of the partial sums were incorrect, however.
The reason being that Grace, for 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ... instead of taking 1/4
of the spaces to get the second distance below, she took 1/2 of the spaces (in
fact she did that same thing, taking 1/2 the spaces for the other graphs also).
She did the arithmetic of adding 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16 correctly, but in marking off
1/16, she used 4 spaces (1/2 of 8 spaces), instead of 2 spaces (1/4 of 8
spaces).</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.mathman.biz/images/grace/gracecorgr.jpg" width="560" height="708"></p>
<p align="left">Don sent this graph to Grace so she could see the correct
spacing on the right.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, Grace did some guess my rules on p. 88 of Don's
worksheet book. These were all correct. <b><font color="#FF00FF" size="4">Fine

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi Duck-Hye,<br>
You should give Grace a <b><span style="font-size:18.0pt">big hug </span></b>(and
one for me too if that's ok ;-) ), for doing such a fine job last evening with
the graphs of the partial sums! <b>Last evening was the <u>first</u> time I
wrote things under the webcam and one of my students was able to see what I
wrote! </b>Thank you for letting that happen. Very exciting! She said she is
working on the generalization of the infinite series, starting with 2/5 +
(2/5)^2 + (2/5)^3 + ... She could use a calculator to see what happens with an
infinite series and predict what it's going to.<br>
<br>
My computer genius friend Darryl will be in touch with you about where to send
your video signal. Do you have &quot;webcam 32&quot; as the software? It's his
birthday this weekend with many friends in from Chicago,&nbsp; it will be
sometime this week. I gave him both your email as well as Graces.<br>
<br>
Do you have a tower puzzle, and shuttle puzzle? See the materials list in my
appendix.<br>
<br>
Did you talk to Grace? She really sounded good and into the math last evening. I
couldn't hear her, but she could hear me on AIM and see my video. We're getting
there! Thank you so much for making it possible for my being able to work with
Grace! I really appreciate this.<br>
<br>
Cordially, Don
<hr>
<b>Sept. 9, 2001 Don's email to Grace</b><br>
Hi Grace,<br>
<br>
That was fine work you did last night!! What happens if your infinite series
looks like&nbsp; 1/n + (1/n)^2 + (1/n)^3 + ... what does this go to?<br>
<br>
For 2/5 + (2/5)^2 + (2/5)^3 + ... use a calculator to help predict what it's
going to. OK?<br>
<br>
Thank you for working with me Grace, I really enjoy seeing you do these great
things. You know Grace, what we're doing is normally done in 11th grade?! That's
why when you make a mistake now, that's ok, because you don't have to think you
need to know everything right away, like in school, like for a test on Friday!
You are getting a fine start, on important mathematics, that even the best
mathematicians struggled with and made lots of mistake with. Here is the quote
from Kline's book about this:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica">&quot;In his first paper on the Calculus
(1669), Newton proudly introduced the use of infinite series to expedite the
processes of the calculus...<br>
<br>
As Newton, Leibnitz, the several Bernoullis, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and
other 18th-century men struggled with the strange problem of infinite series and
employed them in analysis, they perpetuated all sorts of blunders, made false
proofs, and drew incorrect conclusions; they even gave arguments that now with
hindsight we are obliged to call ludicrous.&quot;<br>
<br>

Kline<br>
<br>

<hr>
<font size="3"><b>Sept. 10, 2001 email Grace’s Mom to Don</b></font><br>
Hi,<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
<p class="MsoNormal">I tried to order shuttle puzzle and tower puzzle using the
phone #, but they said that they could not find shuttle puzzle. They said that
they need catalog number or ISBN #. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then I very carefully looked at the pictures of the toys in
Chapter 6 of your book. I think that I can make up shuttle puzzle or do what you
suggested. Should Grace do shuttle puzzle next? I read your book and it is
really engaging!<o:p>

<b>Sept. 10, 2001 email Grace to Don</b><br>
The following came to Don in an attached Excel file in this email from Grace:
<align="left"><img border="0" src="http://www.mathman.biz/images/grace/gracesept10exc.jpg" width="744" height="894">
<align="left">Grace did this fine work in MS Excel; she has been working in
excel for a couple of years now.&nbsp; Don saw where the 2/5,&nbsp; 4/25, 8/125,
and 16/625 comes from in the list above for 2/5, but he didn't understand where
the 3/293 and the other numbers came from. Similarly in the list for 3/7. Tune
in tomorrow to see!
<p>From what Grace said, evidently Excel doesn't allow more that 2 digits in the
numerator and 3 digits in the denominator of a fraction. The decimal looks fine,
approaching .666...=2/3</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Don</b><b> said: </b>&quot;Grace is moving along fine
now. She likes the Excel, but it doesn't give answers with more than 2 digits in
the numerator of a fraction... it looked strange until she told me what
happened. Better if she did stuff like that on a calculator, then write it down.
I suggested she graph the shuttle puzzle rule and start working on solving
equations in Ch. 8., and graph x^2 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>=
y and look for patterns. I would like Grace to make up a test for herself on Ch.
1 (4 or 5 questions), maybe one might be to write 0.232323... as a reduced
fraction, and she could make up a rule and study the differences, you could make
up a rule ( like 5x-2=y and x^3 +4=y ) for her to figure out&quot;.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Don</b><b> said:</b>&nbsp;&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
 I'm pleased with what Grace is doing! The old question is, however: does she
&quot;know&quot; what she is doing? Can she apply her knowledge? Can she do
these things without my book around? As the teacher do I know that she knows
what she is doing? As a parent you want to know these answers. We are having a
good time, but can she do well on the SSAT test (Secondary School <o:p>
</o:p>
 Admissions Test - used for private school admissions test like UNI high
school-for bright kids here, and other private high schools). Will she do better
on the ACT and SAT tests? From my experiences this will surely happen. I have
copies of the SSAT test which I will send up and she can..&quot;<o:p>

</o:p>
 <font color="#FF0000">***</font> Wow, you must have pretty much experience with
parents! I am also worried that Grace and William really know what they are
doing. <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Don</b><b> said:</b>&nbsp;&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
 ..start working on that. I had dinner tonight with a student and her parents,
whom I had from age 5 through UNI high, and she got a 5 on the AP calculus test.
She will be 21 in a couple of months and is living in Munich, Germany with her
Italian boyfriend, and attending the Univ. there. She, from her father who is a
musician and on the faculty of the UIUC retired now, is a <o:p>
</o:p>
 fine viola player. Her brother, whom I also had for quite a while, just entered
Princeton to major in Physics. Another student Ian (in my book alot), worked
with me for about 12 years and with a scholarship, received his Ph.D. in
mathematics at the U of Chicago, a couple of years ago. If we can continue with
Grace, I'm sure she has the drive and ability to go beyond your dreams! I also
hope they will get down here to work with me personally some time. Perhaps on a
Saturday or Sunday. It's only a 2 1/2 - 3 hour drive. Get here at Noon, I work
with them for 2 hours, then drive back the same day. Do this a couple of times a
semester. What do you think?&quot;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sept. 17, 2001</b> Don's response to Duck-Hye</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Duck-Hye,<br>
<br>
It was very exciting to know you are coming down Saturday! I have a student who
may be here from 12 Noon to about 1:45, so 2pm would be perfect. Then you all
can also get a bite to eat before math.<br>
<br>
You can be the judge whether David (or all of them, for that matter), can go the
2 hours. Of course it's also possible they'll want to go over 2 hours! ;-) You
said &quot; One thing is that I am worried about David. As I said, he is very
slow learner. I am not sure if he can do this math!&quot; Duck-Hye, sometimes a
youngster like David, with very bright parents, is overwhelmed trying to live up
to them. So he might <b>think</b> he can't do it. I consider myself a slow
learner! I find youngsters like that are very bright and can do a lot! Of course
I don't know until I work with him. I hope you will bring David and I can try
things with him. <b><span style="color:fuchsia">I expect all kids to do more
than the parents or I, believed they could.</span></b><br>
<br>
Thank you, Duck-Hye. And I'm excited also that Kyusuk is pleased with their
work.<br>

</b>Hi Grace,<br>
You say the area in figure a) is 2/3, but your infinite series is&nbsp; 1/4 +
(1/4)^2 = ,,, which goes to 1/3. I don't understand??? For b) you have the area
= 1/4, but your infinite series is 1/2 + (1/2)^2 + ... which goes to 1. I'm
confused.
<p class="MsoNormal">On the snowflake cure, what do you get for the area of each
one? A1 = 1, A2 = 1 + 3/9, what's A3 and A4 ?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The pattern for the snowflake curve is to multiply

<p class="MsoNormal">What you said Grace, was that each term is 4/9 of the
previous one, STARTING WITH THE THIRD TERM; that was very fine, Grace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The infinite series for the snowflake curve area is:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1 + 1/3 + 12/81 + 48/729 + ... = 1 + 3/9 + 3*4/9*9 +
3*4*4/9*9*9 + 3*4*4*4/9*9*9*9 + 3*4*4*4*4/9*9*9*9*9 + ... = 1 + 3/9 + 3/9 * (4/9

<p class="MsoNormal">Now in the parentheses,&nbsp; 4/9 + 16/81 + 64/729 +

infinite series equal to or go to?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then you have to add 1 + 3/9 + 3/9*( what here?)&nbsp; ,
then you have it! ;-)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You're doing very well, Grace, but just finish it now, to
get a number that the area of the snowflake goes to.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The infinite series for the
area in a): 2 * [1/4 + (1/4)^2 + (1/4)^3 + ...] = 2* 1/3 = 2/3 right!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The infinite series for the area in b):1/4 * [1/2 + (1/2)^2

<p class="MsoNormal">Don suggested she add theses 2 fractions, then use her
calculator to divide to change it to a decimal and see if it equals 0.102470247…
Don thinks it is important that the <b>student</b> be able to check her work.
From earlier&nbsp; discussions on patterns in repeating decimals (like 4/9
=0.4444… and 0.747474… = 74/99), Grace knew that 0.02470247…= 0247/9999

wanted to see if she would find her mistake. He had confidence she would.</p>

12 smaller triangles (3*3) that are added to the star. And there are 9 of these

9*9, which is 81. This is how I got 1 + 3/9 + 12/81.</p>

Hi Don,</p>
<p>For the snowflake, I got 1 + 3/9 + 3/9 * 4/5&nbsp;= 1 and 27/45.</p>
<p>Grace</p>
<p><b>Oct. 13 Grace</b> <b>phones Don</b> to tell him the area is 1 3/5 !! So
the area of the snowflake is finite and approaches 1 3/5 as the limit.</p>
<p>Don told Grace that that she got the right answer for the fraction equal to
this infinite repeating decimal 0.1027027…<b>if the 1 repeats,</b> and equals

&nbsp;<br>
I found out that the infinite series for the perimeter of the snowflake curve
is:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
1 + 1/3 + 4/9 + 48/81 + ... = 1 + 1/3 + 1*4/3*3 + 1*4*4/3*3*3 + 1*4*4*4/3*3*3*3

1024/243 + ...).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the parenthesis, 4/3 + 16/9 + 64/27 + 256/81 + 1024/243 + ... goes to 4/-1.<br>

So, 1 + 1/3 + 1/3 * 4/-1 = 4/-3.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
</o:p>
 I know that 0.1 equals to 1/10.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To get from 0.027 to 0.0027, I
would have to divide by ten.<o:p>

 4. Now, since I found the fractions for the decimals, I added:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">1/10
+ 27/9990 = 1026/9990<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
</o:p>
 5. Finally, to check my answer, I divided 1026 by 9990, which equals to
0.1027027027… which is correct!<o:p>

</o:p>
 In the parenthesis, 4/3 + 16/9 + 64/27 + 256/81 + 1024/243 + …goes to
infinity because when you square numbers smaller than 1, it gets smaller. But if
you square numbers bigger than 1, it gets bigger. And 4/3 is greater than 1! <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
 The infinite series cannot go to a number because to get a limit, A/B has to be
less than 1. So, the infinite series goes to infinity and the perimeter goes to
infinity.</span></p>

<p align="left">The problems below were originally done by hand 
by Alex, a 6th grader. These figures were computer-enhanced, mainly for readability 
purposes.</p>


<p align="left">One 
of my calculus students was talking about the downward slope of her 
driveway into their garage, which made it very difficult to maneuver in 
the winter time. I brought up the pitch of a roof (really 1/2 the 
slope), the gradient of a road (given in %), the pitch of a screw, etc.</p>

<p align="left">The following were done from a topographic map.</p>

You can see that he found, not surprisingly, that east-central Illinois is 
quite flat and the slope is 0/2400 = 0. There are other nearby spots not as flat as the part he 
chose.&nbsp; You could do this near your house or school.</p>

elevation or height of the mountain from the map, measured to the approximate
base of the mountain. He made a scale drawing, and found the slope to be 0.304 .
The slope turns out to be the tangent of the angle of elevation. Using his Dad's
calculator -- he used tan<sup><span style="position:relative;top:-3.0pt;
mso-text-raise:3.0pt">-</span>1 </sup>0.304, the angle whose tangent is 0.304 or
the inverse tangent of 0.304 (make sure you are in degree mode). He found the

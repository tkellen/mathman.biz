<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Lizzy and Cheryl, 7th graders,
find the sum of an infinite series- 2 ways!</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">&quot;Using squares (see Mr. Cohen's chapter
1) we found what these infinite series went to:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Liz_Cheryl.jpg" width="201" height="223"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Let's say you have the problem 2/5 + (2/5)<sup>2
</sup>+ (2/5)<sup>3 </sup>+ ..., what would you do? Normally you would do all
the work and spend lots of time on the problem, but what if there was a
shortcut? You could go on forever with this problem by just increasing the
number of terms. Well, if you want to do it in a flash, then use the simple
rule&nbsp; A/(B-A).. (<font size="3">the girls spent a lot of
time developing this rule</font><font size="2">), </font><font size="3">where</font><font size="2">
</font>A is the numerator, B is the denominator of the
original fraction. So 2/5 + (2/5)<sup>2 </sup>+ (2/5)<sup>3 </sup>+ ... would go
to 2/(5-2) = 2/3.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><b>Another way to do this was done by one of Mr.
Cohen's students, Jeff. Jeff's idea was to change the original fraction into one
that has 1 for the numerator. When you use Jeff's way&nbsp; 2/5 becomes 1/2.5 .
Then you can use the other technique above. When the problem has 1 for the
numerator, you can use the rule that it goes to 1/(n-1), in this case, 1/(2.5-1)
= 1/1.5 = 2/3 &quot;.</b></font></p>

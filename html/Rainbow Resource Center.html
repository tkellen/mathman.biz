than arithmetic, and that math is truly an art, not just a “get the right
answer, please” subject. For much of math is not coming up with one, correct
answer; it is conceptual and <em>interesting</em>! However, what a child attains
in the way of mathematical understanding is directly related to our expectations
of what he can achieve. And the typical math curriculum for younger children
reveals much about our expectations. In fact, when Don Cohen presents his
program as appropriate for ages seven and up (yes, seven and up), your initial
reaction may be that it’s just for the gifted. Not so! Mark, at age seven, is
ready for most of the concepts explored. In fact, the videotapes are aimed at 6-
to 11-year olds. Don’s admonition to “start important math early” is
well-grounded in his own experience with young children, and advice we should
consider. Young children are naturally fascinated by the “art” part of math.
Iteration and infinite sequences, key concepts in calculus, are delightful to
contemplate for a naturally curious six-year-old. Take this beginning example:
start with a square, and keep filling in half of the remaining portion (Don
supplies a nice gridded square in the <em>Worksheets</em> to illustrate this).
Each time, cut the remaining section in half. You get smaller and smaller
“leftovers”, but you <em>never</em> fill it all in! Mark found this
fascinating, and had no trouble understanding the concept. I found the whole
idea behind Don’s books and videos intriguing; concepts are presented in an
understandable and thought-provoking way, encouraging the student to use
hands-on exploration to “discover” many concepts foundational to calculus.
It reminded me somewhat of <em>Miquon</em>, only with more involvement by the
reader, and is well suited to questioning minds of all ages. The heart of the
course is a small, wire-bound “text,” very brief and clear. The small text
is now only available in an electronic PDF format on the <em>Calculus By and For
Young People CD-ROM</em>. Most of this material is repeated, in a more usable
format for the investigator, on the <em>Worksheets</em> <em>on</em> <em>CD-ROM</em>
(it is not necessary to purchase both). The worksheets are PDF files, and are
large, making the program more accessible to the young reader, and the pages are
uncluttered. Don truly has a knack for presenting these ideas and explorations
in a way that children quickly become caught up and actively involved in
deducing the principles he’s leading them to uncover. He teaches techniques of
discovery that will improve their ability to solve problems everyday, and not
just in the area of math. In fact, several of the explorations include more than
a bit of science, as orderly design is evident in creation. The chambered
nautilus is studied, as are pineapple leaves, sunflower stalks, light
reflection, and a ratio of surface area to volume of rods that leads to a
discovery of why rats are nocturnal animals! I got absorbed in the book
immediately, pondering his follow-up questions that take you past the immediate
discovery, into uncharted waters! <em>Calculus By and For Young People</em> is
empowering for anyone who has natural curiosity! As far as implementation, I
would suggest using this course here and there throughout elementary ages
(perhaps during summer months), and certainly <em>before</em> your student
reaches calculus as a regular math course because it teaches the <em>concepts</em>
behind the numbers so much better than traditional calculus books. Anyone who
can read can be set loose with the <em>Worksheets on CD-ROM</em> with no adult
intervention. Younger children can benefit from the videos. The <em>Infinite
Series</em> video parallels chapter 1 in the text and would be a helpful for the
teacher who is not confident about this type of math instruction. The <em>Iteration
to Infinite Sequences</em> video parallels chapter 8. Last is the Map of
Calculus. The map is a large (15”x 18”) flowchart which illustrates how
ideas from each chapter connect to one another and contribute to the development
of calculus. The Complete Set contains all of Don Cohen’s Calculus for Young
People materials, bundled into a two disk CD-DVD set. Materials included on the
CDs are: the Calculus By and For Young People complete text, the worktext, the
Infinite Series video, the Iteration to Infinite Sequences video, the Map to
Calculus, Changing Shapes with Matrices, and the “On Thinking About and Doing
Mathematics” poster. All print materials are in .pdf format, and videos are
Windows Media files.<o:p>

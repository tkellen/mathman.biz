<h4><font face="Arial">A Quest For The Sacred Golden Pineapple, Pine Cone and Artichoke</font></h4>
<font face="Arial">
by Tara Alan, age 15; Don's granddaughter.</font></center>
<p><font face="Arial">One day, a very long time ago, a young princess lived in a golden castle. She
was twenty- one years old. She was so very beautiful, and everyone loved her
because she too had golden proportions. Her name was Geometra. All of her family
was golden. Even her dog, Fibonacci, and her magic golden winged horse,
Goldielocks, were indeed golden. One day, her father, King Pentagram came to see
Geometra. Geometra was outside, basking in the sun, and enjoying nature. She
loved to observe all plants and animals, and most of her time was spent doing
just that.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Geometra, my beautiful daughter, I have something to tell you. You
understand how important it is for the world to be golden, don't you Geometra?&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Of course father, without a golden world, people would only see the
pain and suffering, and not stop to look at the beauty.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Exactly, Geometra. But I have a problem. Our followers are planning a
revolt against us, because they believe only man made things can be
golden.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Oh father! How terrible! How stupid of them! Of course, nature is full
of the golden mean! What are we going to do, father? You are too busy to do
anything about it, mother is also too busy, looking after Pent Jr.!&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;This is why I have come--to ask of you a favor. You are old enough now,
I believe, to have a quest. Your mission is to find three examples of the golden
mean in nature. If you complete this task, you will forever be remembered in
history, and people will look up to you as a heroine. If you do not complete
this task, our reign will end, and the world will be filled with chaos. You must
prove it to the people. I know you can do it. Prove yourself a woman.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;But father, how do I do it?&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Use the golden force, Geometra, trust yourself on this quest, and be
brave. I love you, my daughter. Now go!&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Geometra jumped on her horse, grabbed her dog, and off they went, riding into
the pinewoods, not knowing what to expect next. Pretty soon, she came upon a
clearing. She got off of Goldielocks, and went exploring. No sooner had she
walked four yards, when she came upon the oddest little house you ever did see.
She went to the door and knocked. A little old man came to the door and let her
in.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Hello fair maiden&quot;, he said. &quot;My name is Mathman. Hermit,
painter, and mathematician.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Good day. I am princess Geometra. Pleased to meet you. What a
coincidence! I am in need of some math help.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Oh good!&quot;, Mathman said. &quot;I just love helping people with
math! Sit down, have a bite to eat, and tell me what you need to know.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She told him about the quest, and having to find the golden proportion in
nature. They got to work.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;First of all, you must bring me your three favorite things in nature.
After that, we shall proceed. I will send along with you my son, Goldman, to
protect you and keep you free from danger.&quot; His son, she had noticed, was
very handsome, indeed, and she thought to herself that that was a good name for
him. She was a very firm believer in feminism though, so she said:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Thank you very much, sir, but I can do very well on my own without any
man to protect me, but I appreciate the offer. Now if you'll excuse me, I have
my three favorite things in nature to get: a pineapple, pine cone, and an
artichoke.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">And off she rode on her horse with her little dog. She flew to Hawaii on
Goldielocks, and bought a pineapple at the market. She then flew to a garden
where she picked an artichoke. Later, she realized that it was a witch's garden,
and sort of wished Mathman's son was there, because the witch wasn't too happy
about having her artichoke stolen. After getting the witch and artichoke dispute
settled, she flew back to the pinewoods and picked a pine cone. She got off her
horse and walked to Mathman's house. He opened the door, and greeted her. They
soon got to work.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He said, &quot;Now that you have the three things, we have to establish what
error you will allow in your calculations of the golden mean. I mean, nature
isn't going to be pure gold, so how much can it deviate from 1.61803398...or
.61803398?&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Well&quot;, said Geometra. &quot;How about it can't be larger
than.1.626 or .626, and no smaller than 1.588 or .588?&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Mathman said. &quot;The next thing we have to
do is count the rows naturally present in these plant items. If you take the
pineapple, and count the rows that curve to the left, you count 13 of them. If
you count the rows that curve to the right, there are 8 of them. You also have
to count the rows that are almost vertical. There are 21 of them. What do these
three numbers have in common?&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;They are all fibonacci numbers!!&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Correct as usual, Princess Geometra. Now, divide the numbers found in
the pineapple by the numbers next to them in the fibonacci sequence, that are
also found in the pineapple. In other words, 13/21, 21/13, 8/13, and 13/8. But,
not 8/21 or 21/8 because they aren't next to each other.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Okidoke,&quot; said princess Geometra. She pulled out her pocket
calculator and found that 13/21= .619, 8/13=.615, and 13/8 = 1.615.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Yes!!! These are all close enough to the golden mean! I know what to do
now!&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">She took the artichoke, this time counting the rows curving left, and the
rows curving right. This time there was no almost vertical row. She found that
there were 8 rows curving left and 5 curving right! She was so excited. It too
was almost golden!!! She did the pine cone next. She turned the pine cone upside
down, so she was looking at the base of the pine cone. She counted the rows
going out and left from the center of the pine cone---8!!!!!! Then, she had
trouble counting the rows going out and right from the center of the pine cone,
because she was shaking with excitement! Some how she managed--there were
13!!!!!! She had done it!</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Do you want to see if the pineapple's leaves are golden too?,&quot;
asked Mathman.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Alright!&quot; said Geometra happily. She counted 8 rows of leaves
going right. So far so good. But what was this? She counted 10 rows of leaves
going left!&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Oh no! How can this be?,&quot; she asked.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;It's okay Geometra. Not <i>everything</i> is golden. So, what
conclusions have you come up with?,&quot; Mathman said.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Well, the ratio of consecutive fibonacci numbers gets closer and closer
to the golden mean! And things in nature can be golden!---but not <i>everything</i>
is.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Excellent work, my dear! Your father will be proud.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Thanks Mathman, but I couldn't have done it without you.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Just then, Mathman's son came to her. He was so taken by her beauty that he
asked her to marry him. She said yes, for he was sooo fine. They said thank you
and good-bye to Mathman. They rode back to the golden castle, and sat on
Goldielocks together, in the middle of a chaotic mob. The shouting stopped.
Geometra held up her golden pineapple for all to see and said loudly and clearly
&quot;<b>Gold is found in nature!</b>&quot;. The crowd cheered. Geometra was
looked upon as a heroine, and peace was restored in the kingdom once again. When
the king and queen died, Geometra and her husband became king and queen, and
they were the best rulers the land ever had. Geometra loved her husband, and he
loved her back, and they lived happily ever after.</font>

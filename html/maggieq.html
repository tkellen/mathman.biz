<font face="Arial" size="4">3 April, 2012 , a facebook message from
Maggie Q.&nbsp;
Hello Don! I hope you remember me. I just wanted to send a message to let you know what a positive influence you had on my life growing up. 
I just watched a documentary about the Mandelbrot equation, and it reminded me that you always had a picture of it in your basement and would 
refer to it occasionally. I never really understood it, but I think I get the basic gist of it now.

<p><font size="4" face="Arial">While I didn't grow up to be a mathematician or anything like that, you helped me feel more comfortable around tougher conceptual ideas. You
always had me doing such cool stuff. It made math seems more accessible to me, and increased my self efficacy and self esteem. The basic 
understanding has helped me connect with the world and have a better understanding of current events. I ended up going into business, but work 
on the business and user end of software development, so am around technical 
people every day. I actually got called back twice for a job at Wolfram Alpha, 
but eventually decided to move to Vancouver, BC to be with my family. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial">I have never told you before how much I 
appreciated your help growing up. It meant a lot to me to have someone on my 
team and rooting for me. I had a rougher time as a teenager, perhaps because 
Champaign was so quiet and small, but things have been going really well since 
then. I try to stay current on math and science events, and am fascinated by all 
of it, even if I don't fully understand it. I don't know if I can truly express 
the positive impact that your influence had on me, but I tried! Please take care 
and I wish for all of the best for you and Marilyn! Regards, Maggie Q</font><font size="4">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>Hello there.<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You haven't heard from me in a while, and I just wanted to say that Andrew
hasn't gotten to do as much with your CD's as I would like, but he will
eventually.&nbsp; Andrew's Dad and I decided to have Andrew tested for our
school's enrichment program.&nbsp; The school was reluctant to do it, because
they don't usually test kindergarteners.&nbsp; But we decided to go ahead and do
it anyway.&nbsp; I knew that the testing was going to happen sometime in May, so
I needed to work with Andrew with his reading as well as math.&nbsp; So we kind
of shifted gears for a while.&nbsp; He was tested at the end of May, and he is
now classified as gifted...not that I needed and IQ test to tell me that, but
the school needed one.&nbsp; His perceptual reasoning subscore and memory
subscore were very high......99.5th to 99.9th percentile, and on another part of
the testing his broad math score and math calculation scores were above the 99th
percentile as well.&nbsp; Our school psychologist was wonderful in our meeting
with her to go over the results.&nbsp; She talked about how much she enjoyed
working with Andrew and how much fun she had listening to his logic as he
figured out problems.&nbsp; She was very encouraging.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our principal on the other hand has not been so encouraging.&nbsp; We are trying
to have Andrew accelerated 2 grades&nbsp;in math...we're trying to have him take
an online course for 3rd grade math that our school has access to for free.&nbsp;
And he is trying to make it very difficult for us.&nbsp; Even though Andrew's IQ
testing showed his equivalence level to be 4th grade level in math, and even
though he is working at a 4th grade level on the school's computer program that
all students work on several times a week moving at their own pace, he still
thinks that Andrew should just take 1st grade math like everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
want Andrew to be able to start the 3rd grade course when school starts, but the
principal is insisting that the first grade teacher give him all these
assessments---he wants him to take every single chapter test from the first
grade book and every single chapter test from the 2nd grade book and also any
teacher-made tests as well before he can start the course.&nbsp; I don't mind
him being assessed, but I would like the assessment to be more like an end-of
-the year assessment for each grade.&nbsp; We are trying to fight it, but I
don't know if we're going to win.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, it's not that I don't think Andrew can handle the assessments--I just don't
want him spending the first two months of first grade taking a test every day.<o:p>
</o:p>
</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>Anyway,
we're definitely fighting an uphill battle because our principal is very much
against acceleration of any kind.&nbsp;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#800000">I did want to tell you&nbsp;a little about&nbsp;Andrew's&nbsp;work with graphing
lines,&nbsp;though.&nbsp; He really wanted to do some things with graphing, so
he did some of your worksheets with graphing lines [chapter 6].&nbsp; I
encouraged him to look for patterns, and he was able to figure out that he was
skip counting by 3, 4, and 5 with some of the different equations and
tables....and he was able to figure out what numbers came next both in the
positive and negative direction...he had fun doing it...I would ask him what
number would come next, and he wanted to keep going and going.&nbsp; I remember
with one of them him going all the way down to -42.&nbsp; He also really enjoyed
discovering the patterns with the first infinite series [chapter 1] and was able
to figure out the next terms once he saw the pattern.<o:p>

So when we are finished jumping through some of the hoops with Andrew's school,
we are looking forward to doing much more work with your CD's!<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just wanted to say thank you again for inspiring me and helping me realize
that kids can understand and do so much more with math&nbsp;than many people are
willing to believe.&nbsp; I refuse to allow my school to hold Andrew back and
keep him from being all that he can be!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's sad that I should
even have to say that.&nbsp; <o:p>

I said to our principal and superintendent in our last meeting.&nbsp; We
encourage students to read over the summer, we encourage parents to read with
them.&nbsp; Why aren't we encouraging them to do math with them?&nbsp; Why is
math so often neglected?&nbsp; Why are they acting like I am crazy to want to do
math with my child?&nbsp; Why do they act like it's impossible that my son could
enjoy math?<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#008000"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyway, we hope that you have a great summer!&nbsp; We wish that we lived much
closer so it would be easier for us to come and be a part of your math program,
but maybe some day we will be able to come!<o:p>

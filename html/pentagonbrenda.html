<b><font size="5" face="Arial">Brenda Studies a Regular Pentagon</font></b>


</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Looking at a regular pentagon: Don defined 
the regular pentagon as&nbsp; a 5-sided polygon, all of whose sides are equal 
and whose interior angles are all equal.</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/pentagonreg.jpg" width="405" height="390"></p>
<p align="left">Don drew one diagonal (a segment joining 2 non-adjacent 
vertices). Then Don asked Brenda how many degrees in the sum of interior angles 
of the triangle; she knew this was 180<sup><font face="Arial">o</font></sup>and 
it was an isosceles triangle.</p>
<p align="center">

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Then Don asked her to draw a second diagonal. 
The asked her to find the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon and the 
number of degrees in each interior angle of the pentagon</font>.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../images/pentagon2brenda.jpg" width="409" height="401"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Brenda found the sum of the interior angles 
of the pentagon is 540<sup>o</sup></font> and each angle (all equal), is 108<font face="Arial"><sup>o</sup></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Then he&nbsp; asked her to draw all the 
diagonals in the pentagon, then find all the angles. How many different size 
angles are formed?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Brenda found only 3 different size angles&nbsp; 
36 <sup>o</sup></font>, 72<font face="Arial"><sup>o</sup></font> and 108<font face="Arial"><sup>o</sup></font>.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Then he asked Brenda to measure the diagonal in mm, and a 
side in mm, then find the ratio of the diagonal to the side. Then find the ratio 
of the Sin 72<sup>o</sup> to the Sin 36<sup>o</sup>. Her results are on the page 
below..</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/pentagonbrenda.jpg" width="979" height="1257"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Brenda found the ratio of the diagonal to the side of the 
pentagon was 1.6</font> <font face="Arial">and the ratio of the sin 72<sup>o</sup></font>to 
the sin 36<font face="Arial"><sup>o</sup></font> is also 1.618.</p>
<p><font face="Arial">They talked about the ratios she found to be 
approximations of the golden mean or divine proportion 1.618033...She also saw 
another pentagon inside the original, and talked about extending the sides of 
the original pentagon to get a larger one. And a pentagram (star) was also 
formed inside the original pentagon. Don later found someone on Mathfuture 
google group had proven that the sum of the angles of the pentagram touching the 
vertices of the original pentagon, is 180<sup>o</sup>.</font></p>

Brenda!!</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">See other links to the golden mean and Fibonacci numbers 
are at the lower left, on Don's <a href="http://www.mathman.biz/html/map.html">A 
Map To Calculus</a></font></p>

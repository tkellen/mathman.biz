CONCEPTS TO 10 YEAR OLD STUDENTS IN A MAINSTREAM ENVIRONMENT</b></p>

<p>D. Cohen developed a cognitive instructional program for teaching calculus to
children. This study was conducted to systematically implement and evaluate the
program's effectiveness in lower-socio economic status classroom environment.
Twenty-six ten year-old students received instruction in the calculus concepts
of limits and infinite series using Cohen's approach. An adjacent classroom,
which also had 26 students, served as a control. Pre tests and post tests in
calculus concepts understanding and attitudes to mathematics were administered
to both groups. Results indicated that ten year old students can learn calculus
concepts in a group instructional format. While the pretest indicated a lag in
scores achieved by girls, there were no significant gender differences in the
post tests. We conclude that the teaching and learning of calculus can be
achieved in mainstream classrooms using the conceptual instructional program
designed by Cohen&quot;.</p>

<h2>Sample Problems from &quot;Changing Shapes With Matrices&quot;</h2>
</center><br>
<b>Ch. 1: Plotting points - graphing linear equations -</b>See chapter 6 in
&quot;Calculus By and For Young People- Worksheets&quot;
<p><b>Ch. 2: Grocery-store arithmetic to multiply matrices</b><br>
We go to the store to buy some things. What shall we buy? OK, we'll buy some
milk(M), some hotdogs(HD) and some buns(B). How much of each? 2 cartons of milk,
8 hot dogs and 10 buns.&nbsp; The milk costs 80'/carton, the hot dogs 30'
each, and the buns cost 12' each. We write this information in matrix form
below. How much does everything cost?<br>

<p>Everything cost 420' or $4.20. One multiplies by going across to the right
on the first matrix and down the second matrix, multiplying then adding.</p>
<p><b>Ch. 3: Steps to do a transformation and Valorie's work</b><br>
Steps to do a geometric transformation using matrices:<br>
1. Make a shape. The shape I chose was the &quot;dog&quot; (simple, not too many
points).<br>
2. Pick out about 10 points on the shape.<br>
3. Write down the coordinates of these points.<br>
4. Number each of these points to make it easier to keep track of things.<br>
5. Pick a 2x2 matrix using only 1's or 0's or -1's (for now). This will be your
transformation matrix. For example, Valorie chose the matrix: <img align="middle" src="../images/valsmatr.gif" width="100" height="77"><br>
6. Multiply each point (as a matrix) by your transformation matrix to get a new
point.<br>
7. Plot each new point and number it, keeping a correspondence with the old
points.<br>
8. Connect the new points as you go, using a color different from the original
shape.<br>
9. Complete all the new points and close the shape (if it's a closed figure),
then look at the new shape carefully. Try to figure out what your matrix did to
the original shape. Then ask questions about the situation.<br>

<b>Ch. 4 Asking questions &amp; Other Student Work</b><br>
Try changing the doggie with Mark's matrix: <img align="middle" src="../images/markmat.gif" width="101" height="80"><br>
What matrix would rotate the dog 90 degrees counterclockwise?<br>
What matrix would reflect the dog in the x-axis?<br>
How many 2x2 matrices with 0's, 1's, and <sup>-</sup>1's can you make?

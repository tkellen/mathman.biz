<p class="MsoNormal">'There are many teachers who are boring and not original.
They do not make learning fun, they do not explain things clearly, and avoid
letting youngsters do &quot;challenging&quot; work. However, there are ideal and
exceptional teachers who are just the opposite. I believe that a mathematics
teacher name Mr. Donald Cohen is one of those ideal and exceptional teachers.<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Donald Cohen is an ideal and exceptional teacher
because he is creative and makes learning fun. While other teachers try to bore
you down with memorizations of math terms, he encourages students to explore and
make mistakes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He believes that it is not impossible for youngsters to do
anything. On the other hand, other teachers think that youngsters cannot do
something because it is challenging and new. However, Mr. Donald Cohen actually
thinks that youngsters can do more than adults!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He explains things in a way that is very easy to
understand. Some teachers tell students to memorize formulas, which can be
complicating to understand. On the contrary, Mr. Donald Cohen teaches us by
helping us visualize the math terms and figuring it out. He says,
&quot;Visualization is key&quot;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To be an ideal teacher, the teacher must be creative, make
learning fun, believe that a student can do anything, and explain things in an
easy way. Mr. Donald Cohen has those qualities and more. Therefore, he is an
ideal and exceptional teacher'.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Ashley, age 7, works with Don</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley is from MO, and is Darryl's
niece (he's Don's computer genius friend). She came for about 2 hours <b>Tues.
August 14, 2001</b> when she worked on the following:</font></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial">Don started off with 2x3 she knew 6, then when Don
wrote 2x30 and read it as 2x3tens = she said she'd never done that. A little
mumbling from Don and she said 60. Then she had no problem from there on. Don
read each problem as he wrote it, because it is important for her to hear the 3
hundred, the 3 million, .. so she knows the answer is 6 hundred or 6 million,
and this just carries along to make the other problems just as easy.</font>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/ashleyx.jpg" width="614" height="1076"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">When asked to make up a problem she
wrote 2x43= and shoved her book to Don for him to do!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Don then got out the
&quot;cookies&quot;-the 3x5&quot; cards and asked Ashley to share 5 cookies
between 2 people. She gave herself 1 and Don 1 cookie. The she cut the remaining
cookie into 2 pieces, which she said was 1/2. Then they each person had 2 1/2
cookies.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Then they did the graph of the
equation x + y = 7. She knew about negative numbers and continued the numbers on
the x-number line to the left and continued the numbers on the y-number line
down, with negatives. Following &quot;the yellow brick road&quot; - the pattern,
she was able to predict points and then check to see if this point made the
sentence true. Ashley knew 8 + <sup>-</sup>1 = 7.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/Ashleygr.jpg" width="544" height="686"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Don asked her what the graph of x +
y = 9 would look like and how it would be different from the one they had done.
Don decided to leave that question for next time. When she about to leave, Don
asked Ashley to find the 2 numbers for the point which is between 4 and 5 on the
x-axis and between 2 and 3 on the y-axis above.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">At various points in their
discussion, Ashley would ask something like &quot;is it 7?&quot; And Don would
ask her &quot;Are you asking me or telling me it's 7?&quot; She knew it was 7,
so Don told her to say it like you mean it, without the question. Don said it
like he wanted her to say it, by lowering the pitch instead of raising it when
one asks a question. Don thinks this is a matter of her lack of self confidence,
sometimes fear of saying the &quot;wrong answer&quot;. Ashley is not alone in
this at all. Many youngsters are afraid of making mistakes or and lack
confidence in what they are doing, <i>especially in math</i>. That's one way he
deals with this. Then at one point she said she was stupid, and Don told her she
is very smart and don't even think that! <b><font color="#FF0000">Don thinks
raising their self-confidence is as important as them learning the mathematics!
Once they realize they can do it, there is no stopping them from learning </font><font color="#008000">anything</font><font color="#FF0000">!</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley worked on the <b><font color="#FF00FF"><a href="/html/prob6.html">Shuttle
Puzzle</a></font></b>, which was difficult for her. Don suggested she start with
one pair of pegs, then work up. He saw that at 3 pairs of pegs she was getting
frustrated. So he brought out the <b><font color="#FF00FF">geoboard</font></b>.
He also gave her some <font color="#FF00FF"><b>spotty paper</b></font> for her
to draw the shapes she made on the geoboard and find the area within them. (see
some <a href="/html/geoboard.html">student work
with the geoboard</a>)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../images/ashlgeo12.jpg" width="174" height="251">&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../images/ashlgeo2.jpg" width="247" height="95"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley accepted that 1 can of paint
would cover the square above left (has an area of 1). She was very good at
drawing the shapes. The shape above right, she said would have an area of 2. Don
made a rectangle around the triangle and she agreed that the triangle would have
an area of 1 (1/2 the 2), plus 1 for the square = 2.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../images/ashlgeo112.jpg" width="187" height="176"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley made other shapes which she
was able to find the area (one was 6 1/2 units). Then he thought she needed to
do a harder one; he made the triangle above. She guessed 2 1/2 for its area. She
had trouble drawing the shape so Don put the spotty paper over the geoboard and
pushed the paper down over the nails. Then she could feel the rubber band and
draw the triangle. Then Don put a red rubber band around the triangle to form a
square. Ashley knew its area was 4.&nbsp; He said &quot; if we can find the area
of the 3 pieces outside the triangle, inside the square, we could subtract those
from 4 and get the area of the triangle. She knew the little triangle area was
1/2, the other 2 triangles were each 1 (from the other problem above). So 1 + 1
+ 1/2 = 2 1/2 . So 4 - 2 1/2 = ? or what added to 2 1/2 would make 4? She
figured that to be 1 1/2, which was the area of the triangle she was looking
for! <b><font color="#FF00FF">Fine job Ashley!</font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Don got out the <b><font color="#FF00FF"><a href="/html/prob6.html">Tower
Puzzle</a></font> </b>for her to try. She worked on this for about a half hour.
Don asked Ashley if she wanted to borrow the Tower Puzzle and bring it back on
Thursday, when she agreed to return. She signed it out on Don's sign-out list
(and Darryl signed out the book &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; by Spencer
Johnson, M.D., published by G. P. Putnam's Sons, NY). Don keeps 2 copies of this
book for his students and/or parents to read.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Darryl relayed to Don the next
morning, that after she left Don's house, Ashley figured out the Tower Puzzle
and was able to show someone else how it works that night. She also told Darryl
she was anxious to return on Thursday.</font></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial"><b>Thursday:</b>&nbsp; [Upon arriving for her
session with Don, Ashley yawned a lot, as if she was tired. But she stayed for
about 2 hours!]</font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Tuesday's problem was to share 5 cookies between
2 people, and each person got 2 1/2 cookies. Ashley hadn't written this answer,
so Don asked Ashley to just write the 2 1/2 in her notebook, and she did.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Don had Ashley find the 2 numbers for the point
which is between 4 and 5 on the x-axis and between 2 and 3 on the y-axis on the
graph of x + y = 7. After a couple of incorrect answers she realized it was 4
1/2 on the x-axis. She tried 4, then 3 for the y-number. Whatever she said it
had to add with 4 1/2 to get 7. She added 4 1/2 + 4 and got 8 1/2 instead of 7.
And 4 1/2 + 3 she realized was 7 1/2, again not 7. Then she went for 2 1/2. 4
1/2 + 2 1/2 = 7 and that worked! So the 2 numbers for that point were (4 1/2, 2
1/2). Then when Don gave her the point up one and left one from this point she
got (3 1/2, 3 1/2).</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Don had Ashley draw the square numbers on squared
paper, going to 5<sup>2</sup> = 5x5 = 25, and coloring in the L-shaped pieces.
He started with the 1 by 1 square, then asked her to do the 2by2 square and
write down 2<sup>2</sup> = 2x2 = 4, the number of squares in the 2 by 2 square.
The numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are the square numbers and the L-shaped
differences 1, 3, 5, 7,... are the odd numbers. See Tara's work on the <a href="/html/tara2.html">square
numbers</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley tried to make the 3x3x3 cube using the 7
soma pieces. Don asked if she would like to make these pieces and she proceeded
to glue the 1 cm cubes together to do that. (See <a href="/html/olivia.html">Olivia's
work on the Soma cubes</a>). She put her pieces in a bag to dry and took them
home.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley started on 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...&nbsp; She
got as far as shading in 1/2, then half of the half. Don asked her what fraction
of the whole cake this was. How many of these pieces make a whole cake. She
found 4, so Don explained that if 4 make the whole cake, each piece is 1/4 of
the cake. Then she said she was tired of coloring.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Don gave Ashley the equation 2</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>x</sup></font><font size="3" face="Arial">
<img align="middle" src="../images/box.jpg" width="19" height="21"> + 3 = 17, which he read as 2 times

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Ashley then asked about the balance scale with
weights. Each weight was 10 grams, rectangular with a hole in it to hang on the
scale. The scale had numbered hooks, 10 to 1 on the left side and 1 to 10 on the
right side, on which to place the weights. For example she put 2 weights at 5 on
the left side and these balanced 1 weight on 10 on the right side. She worked
for at least 1/2 hour on problems she made up or Darryl made up, or Don made up.
<b><font color="#FF00FF">Well done Ashley!</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Before she left, Don wrote down some chapters in
his worksheet book that she had started and could continue at home, including
the graph of x + y = 9, solving the equation 2</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><sup>x</sup></font><font size="3" face="Arial">

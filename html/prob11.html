<h2>Sample Problems from Chapter 11</h2>
</center><br>
<b>Chapter 11</b>: Compound Interest to <b>e</b> and <b>i</b>
<hr>
<font color="#ff0000">The important thing about doing most math is that we
really want more than the answer, we want to generalize the answer, to find the
answer for any problem like we're workin on.</font><br>
Ian, at age 11, came to me with the problem- what would his Dad pay in monthly
installments on a house worth $10,000 at a 10% annual interest, with a 30 year
mortage- he really wanted a number for an answer. This got us working on the
simpler problem of investing and finding the interest.
<p><font color="#C040C0">I must say that I don't know everything, and make a lot
of mistakes, in spite of what my students might believe.</font> So I wasn't able
to give Ian a quick answer, but he and I worked very hard to solve his problem.
We started this way.<br>
<p><b>1. Simple interest.&nbsp;</b>Find the amount you have in the bank after 2
years if you put in $1, at a 6% annual rate of interest. (It will always be an
annual rate of interest with all the problems below.)<br>
The Interest = Principal&nbsp; *&nbsp; rate&nbsp; *&nbsp; time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I(2 yr) = $1 * .06 * 2 = $.12 and the
amount (A) you would have after 2 years<br>
A = P + I = $1 + $.12 = $1.12 Notice that the interest is <b>not added each year
to get a new principal.<br>
<b>2. Compound interest and 3, and 4. leading to a very important infinite
sequence.</b></b> Here the interest is added after each compounding period.<br>
Find the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, with a principal of $1, at
@6%, compounded <b>semi-annually</b> or <font color="#0000ff">2</font> times per
year.<br>
The interest earned during the first (1/2) year = I(first 1/2 year) =
$1*.06*(1/2) = .06/2 ($.03)<br>
The Amount you have in the bank after the first (1/2) year<br>
A = P + I =<b><font color="#ff0000">(1 + .06/2)</font></b> = $1.03 which will be
the new principal.<br>
I(2nd 1/2 year) = <b><font color="#ff0000">(1 + .06/2)</font></b>* .06/2<br>
A(after 2 (1/2)years)= P + I = <b><font color="#ff0000">(1 + .06/2)</font></b> +
<b><font color="#ff0000">(1 + .06/2)</font></b>*.06/2<br>
Factoring out the term <b><font color="#ff0000">(1 + .06/2)</font></b>, we get<br>
A(after <font color="#0000ff">2</font> (1/2)years) = <b><font color="#ff0000">(1
+ .06/</font><font color="#0000ff">2</font><font color="#ff0000">)</font><sup><font size="-1"><font color="#0000ff">2</b></font></font></sup>
= $1.124 (more than the simple interest after 2 years).<br>
What would the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, putting in $1, at 6%,
compounded quarterly (<b>4 times per year</b>)?<br>
What would the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, putting in $1, at 6%,
compounded monthly (<b>12 times per year</b>)?<br>
What would the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, putting in $1, at 6%,
compounded daily (<b>365 times per year</b>)?<br>
What would the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, putting in $1, at 6%,
compounded <b>10,000 times per year</b>?<br>
What would the amount you have in the bank after 1 year, putting in $1, at 6%,
compounded <b>continuously, (an infinite number of times per year</b>)?<br>

<p><b>5. Naming <b><font size="4">e</font></b><sup><font size="1">x</font></sup><b>
as an infinite series.</b></b><br>
Using the binomial expansion from chapter 9, the first 5 terms of (A + B)<sup><font size="-1">n</sup>

<b>7. Leading to the most exciting single mathematical statement, that contains
the 5 most important numbers in mathematics!</b><br>
<img align="right" src="../images/gexlnxc.gif" width="300" height="293"><font color="#ff0000">This is not
in my books, but happens regularly.</font>When a student works on logs, as in Ch
13., I'll have them find ln(-1). Looking at the graph at the right, you can see
that ln x is the inverse function of <font size="3"><b>e</b></font><sup><font size="-2">x</font></sup>
(they are mirror images of each other in the line y = x), but also there is no
ln of a negative number! Now I'll have the student find ln(-1) in <i>Derive</i>
and lo and behold we get ln x = <font size="3"><b>i</b></font>*Pi, which is not
a real number but an imaginary number... and that shouldn't show up on our graph
at the right. That means that <font size="4"><b>e</b></font><sup><font size="-1"><b>i*Pi</b></font></sup>
= -1 by definition of logs. Adding 1 to each side we get<br>
<center><font color="ff0000"><font size="4"><b>e</b></font><sup><font size="-1"><b>i*Pi</b></font></sup>
+ <b>1</b> = <b>0</b>.</font></center><font color="#FF00FF"> Here are the 5 most
important numbers in mathematics, in one statement!!</font> When I first
encountered this statement in college, I was so excited about it, that I did a
watercolor painting of a circular rainbow with this statement in the center!<br>
In my books I get this same statement using <font size="4"><b>e</b></font><sup><font size="-1"><b>x</b></font></sup>
as an infinite series, then <font size="4"><b>e</b></font><sup><font size="-1"><b>i*x</b></font></sup>
as an infinite series, eventually in terms of cos(x) and sin(x), then put Pi in
for x.<br>
<b>8. Using iteration to do compound interest</b>. Not done here.<br>
<b>9. One result of Ian playing with powers of powers.</b><br>
Ian played with his calculator and powers of powers, during physics class. He
came up with the following expression<img align="middle" src="../images/iane5pop.gif" width="184" height="61">.
If x goes to infinity what does this go to? Click

figured this out.<br>

Notice we get another spiral! (See chapter 6 for other spirals). If you double
the angle, what happens to the length of the radius vector?<br>

never would have seen this graph! Notice, another spiral! (Actually there are 4
spirals here if you look at the endpoints of the segments). And <b><font size="4">i</font></b><sup><b><font size="2">i</sup></font></b>
is a real number! Amazing stuff here.<font color="#ff0000"> One of the finest
math sites on the internet, which has interactive applets, is</font> <a href="http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/index.html">IES
in Japan.</a> One applet inspired by the graph above is at<a href="http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/comp/itoi/itoi.html">

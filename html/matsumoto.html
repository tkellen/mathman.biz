finding square roots by iteration.

I thought of a "new method" of calculating square root of n.
<br>
x^2=n
<br>x^2+mx =n+mx (m is a guess number-Don)
<br>(factor out x on the left side, then divide by m+x )
<br>x=(n+mx)/(m+x) 

<br>(to top, add m^2 and subtract m^2, then

do some algebra to get)

<br>x=m+(n-m^2)/(m+x)

<br>If n is nearly m^2, so this value converge rapidly.

<p>
I iterate f(x)= m+(n-m^2)/(m+x). 

<br>For example: to find the square root of 5, n=5, pick m=2, initial
value
for x=1

<br>2+(5-2^2)/(2+1)=2.3333...
<br>2+(5-2^2)/(2+2.3333...)=2.230769...
<br>2+(5-2^2)/(2+2.230769...)=2.236363...
<br>2+(5-2^2)/(2+2.236363...)=2.236051...
<br>2+(5-2^2)/(2+2.236051...)=2.236068...

<br>These were calculated by MS Excel.

<p>Mr. Matsumoto has read Don's book. He contacted Don by email with this 
idea as well a method of using iteration in solving quadratic equations in
a
way that is different from the 10 ways Don shows in Ch. 8. Don shows
another way
to do square roots by iteration in Ch. 10.<font color=#009900> It's
exciting when people are willing to share their ideas. And it's exciting
to learn new things...There is never an end to learning!!</font> <hr>

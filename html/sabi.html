It is precisely the type<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial Unicode MS'"> </span>of
experience he craves yet is so hard to find for a child his age.&nbsp; It is not
rigid, allows a child to explore advanced concepts in a variety of different
ways, and is the springboard for other discoveries.&nbsp; This kid was on fire

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dec. 7, 2002 </b>Don wrote to Dana to find out if Sabi
was doing stuff in his worksheet book and got this response:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dec. 9, 2002</b>
<br>Actually, we have been working in your book quite a bit
lately.&nbsp; Sabi<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;"><o:p>

the third grade exam, he decided to take a two month sabbatical from EPGY to
explore his other interests.&nbsp; When I get a chance I will scan some of his
latest work. -Dana, Sabi's Mom</p>

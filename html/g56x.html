<br><b>2d.</b> This is a most interesting thing that I found in doing all 
this iteration. <center><img src="../images/gry5-6x.gif" width="362" height="331"></center>
<br>When Jonathan iterated this function, see 2.a, starting with 1, he 
got: 1, 
-1,11, 4.4545, 3.653, 3.358, 3.213,... When I first worked on 
this, I decided to graph consecutive 
pairs of this infinite sequence. What happened was the points started at 
(1,-1), went to (-1,11) on the other part of the curve, then went back to 
the first piece and moved along this section approaching (3,3). This 
of course is the limit of the sequence and the one root of the original 
quadratic equation. WOW!

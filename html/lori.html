Good news! Both Don, for The Math Program, and Lori have received
scholarship monies for needy
students, from local school districts!<p>
1. Don will accept students for work with him in Champaign, IL. Call
1-800-356-4559 for information.<p>
 
2. In KC, MO Lori Johnson Morse sent out the following in her
brochure:<br>
 "CALCULUS BY AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE (ages 7, yes 7 and
up)"<br>
    
  "Mathematics is not the mystery some people think it is, It's just a
way of speaking," says mathematician James Murray.   If math is just
another way of speaking, another language, then the best time to learn
another language is when we are young, when curiosity and imagination are
alive and uninhibited. While a spoken language is vital for communication,
it is just as important to learn mathematics, which is the most powerful
and versatile means we have of exploring our world and how it works.
    <p>The 3-hour, hands-on workshop, "Calculus By and For Young People"
is
based on the book of the same name, written by Don Cohen. The book is
written in terms that a child or anyone able to recognize patterns can
understand.  Your child doesn't have to be gifted, just eager!  Children
7-12 will discover the ease of fractions, "cookie sharing" and infinite
series.  Teens 13-18 will learn creative ways to do and look at geometry,
functions, graphs, and solving equations.  Most importantly your children
will be excited about mathematics and have fun with an instructor who
believes that anyone can learn calculus!  Sign up today.
Instructor: Lori Johnson Morse

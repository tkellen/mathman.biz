<p><font face="Arial" size="3">9/20/00&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><b>Many sessions</b></font>
before this day, Sheri had worked on the <b>Tower Puzzle</b> (see ch. 6). The
object is to move the tower of discs from one peg to another. The rules are: you
can't put a bigger disc on top of a smaller one, you can only move one disc at a
time, and later you will need to move the discs in the minimum # of moves. Don starts young people off with maybe only 3 discs. Then lets the
student start with more.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="../images/towerpuzwood.JPG" width="454" height="237"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On this day, Sheri figured out the rule for the
Tower Puzzle; her work is shown below: </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="../images/powersof2.jpg" width="445" height="600"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">In the process she found patterns in the
table of values- the differences go up 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.. Don
reminded her about writing numbers like these as powers of 2- see her work on the
right above. The y-numbers she noticed were 1 less than these powers of 2.&nbsp;
Don wrote 7 as 2<sup><sup><b>3</b></sup></sup><b><sup><sup>&nbsp;
</sup></sup></b>- 1, then Sheri wrote the
others this way and wrote the rule as 2<b><sup>x</sup></b><sup>
</sup>- 1= y. Don asked Sheri to graph the rule and graph negative values of x.
In the process Sheri got into negative exponents and statements like 1/4 - 1 = <sup><b>-</b></sup>
3/4, which they talked about. See her work above. Her graph (an exponential
function) is shown below:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="../images/sherigr.jpg" width="353" height="511"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">One student said the curve
approaches y = <sup>-</sup>1, and is called the asymptote.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">On 9/21, <b>Don asked Sheri to write
about what she did the day before with the Tower Puzzle</b>. As can often be the
case, students put away their work and forget about it. Don asked her this,
explaining that the reason he asked was to make sure she understood and could
explain what she did. She started to do this and when Don saw her slowing down,
he changed the subject. He suggested she finish at home. (Sheri hasn't finished
this yet, as of 11/2/00.. it's difficult to get young people to write down
things like this. Don will persist!)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">One day Don, a student and her father,
brought&nbsp; to
a welder the 2D graph she did of The Tower Puzzle. He made the 3D rotation of
that curve 2<sup>x </sup>- 1=y with stiff wire, below. Don hangs it in his Math room; in 25 years it has only had
to be repaired once!</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/3D2^x-1.JPG" width="240" height="349"></p>
<p align="left"><span class="apple-style-span"><font color="#008000"><b>Don had
Sheri as a 4-6th grader, then she went to University High School. She came back
as almost a 12th grader, to prepare for Calculus. Don worked with her for about
3 hrs. individually over the last month. Today, a week into her calculus class,
she told me &quot;What we did the last 3 weeks (derivatives),&nbsp;the teacher
did with my class in one day, and I was like the only one in the class that
understood what she was talking about! It really helped for me to talk with you
about the problems as I worked on them&quot;.&nbsp;</b></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><b> <span class="apple-style-span"> <font color="#008000"> It's been a pleasure working with
you Sheri, as well as your sister, your mother, 2 aunts, and 2 cousins over the
years- what a wonderful family!<hr>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000" size="4">Nanako played with the Peg game
(see chapter 6)</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Nanako08/nanakopegpic.jpg" width="308" height="87"></p>
</font>
<p align="left">The object of this puzzle is to interchange the blue and the
red pegs. The rules are 1) you can move to a hole that's next to a peg; 2) you
can jump, but only one peg and it must be of the other color, and 3) you can't
move backwards. You must start with the empty space in the middle and end that
way. You can use golf tees, as I do, or you can use two different kinds of coins
or bottle caps or pieces of colored paper as the pieces.</p>
<font color="#008000">
<p align="left"><font size="3">It takes time for people to
figure out the pattern of how the pieces move, without having to start over. She
was able to do this fairly quickly. Then Don made a table below, where </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000"> x was the
number of pairs of pegs</font><font size="3"><font color="#008000">, and </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000"> y was the number of moves to interchange the
pegs</font><font color="#008000"><font size="3">.
She started with one pair, and it took 3 moves, starting with 2 pairs, took 8
moves.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Nanako08/nanakopeg.jpg" width="566" height="657"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Nanako saw the pattern 1x3=3,
2x4=8, 3x5=15.. could be written as 1(1+2)=3 and 2(2+2)=8 and 3(3+2)=15..
<br>Nanako found the rule x<sub>*</sub>(x+2)=y
with some help from Don. In the
process Don made sure she could </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000"> multiply negative and positive numbers</font><font size="3"><font color="#008000">
with the </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000">pattern</font><font color="#008000"><font size="3">
(see
above at the bottom of the page in the center). She then graphed this function
to get a parabola.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Nanako08/Nanakopeggraph.jpg" width="517" height="727"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">They talked about the graph
having symmetry and the axis of symmetry was x = <sup>-</sup>1.</font></p>

</font><p align="left"><font size="3" color="#0000FF">A teacher at one of Don's
workshops found a pattern that the </font><font color="#0000FF" size="4">hole</font><font size="3" color="#0000FF">
makes as the pegs are moved-very interesting!</font></p>

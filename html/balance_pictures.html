<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#800080"> Using balance pictures to 
solve equations/chapter 8</font></b></p>
<p> A washer is what you put in a faucett to keep it 
from leaking, a flat rubber, penny-shaped thing with a hole in it. In 
the picture below, we solve 5x + 3 = 2x + 18. The x becomes a bag of 
washers, and we are trying to figure out how many washers are in each 
bag. We make a balance scale. On the left is 5 bags and 3 loose washers, 
and on the right side is 2 bags and 18 loose washers. The scale is 
balanced to begin with. The idea is to make the problem simpler by taking 
off bags from both sides or loose ones from both sides, the same from 
both sides, to keep the scale balanced an find out how many washers are in each
bag.</p>

one above, and solve them by making a balance picture for each.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#800000">Maya, age 9, makes up and solves linear equations

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Don had Maya solve a linear equation with x's
on both sides, using balance pictures, like 5x+3=2x+18 above. Each x was represented
by a bag of washers and the dash by a loose washer; <font color="#FF0000">the
object was to figue out how many loose washers were in each bag</font>. Don had
a rubber washer handy to make sure she knew what we were using. He made sure
Maya knew that to keep the balance balanced, she must take the same number of
loose washers or bags of washers from both sides. Maya was able to do this
easily:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Don asked Maya to make up an equation like this; she asked if
she could use fractions! Of course Don said that would be fine. She made up this
one:</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>3x + 1/2 = 2x + 1/4&nbsp; Neat!</b></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Mayasfracequation.jpg" width="615" height="787"></p>

<p align="left">Maya put 3 bags of washers and 1/2 of a washer on the left side,
balancing 2 bags and 1/4 of a washer on the right side. She took off 2 bags of
washers from each side, keeping the scale balanced. She had one bag and 1/2
loose one on the left side and 1/4 of a loose one on the right side. Then she took 1/4 of a
washer from each side (she put a bag there, but paid no attention to it). Maya
ended with one bag and 1/4 of a washer on the left side, and zero on the right
side. Then they discussed the situation, and Maya tried <font size="2"><b><sup>-</sup></b></font>1/2
of a washer for what was in the bag. She realized that <font size="2"><b><sup>-</sup></b></font>1/2
+ 1/4 would equal <font size="2"><b><sup>-</sup></b></font>1/4, not zero. Maya
then said the bag must
contain <font size="2"><b><sup>-</sup></b></font>1/4 washers which when added to
1/4 would equal zero! So the answer to the equation was <b> x = <font size="2"><sup>-</sup></font>1/4</b></p>

<p align="left">Then Maya asked if she could make up an equation with decimals.
She made up this one:</p>

<p align="center"><b>2.6x + .6 = 3.5x + .5</b></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Mayasdecquation.jpg" width="511" height="627"></p>

<p align="left">Maya took 2 bags off each side, obtaining </p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>

<p align="center">.6&nbsp; bags + .6 loose ones = 1.5 bags + .5 loose ones. </p>

        </blockquote>

<p align="left">She then took off .5 loose ones from each side, obtaining</p>

<p align="center">.6 bags + .1 loose one = 1.5 bags </p>

<p align="left">She then took off&nbsp; .6 bags from both sides, obtaining</p>

<p align="center">.1 = .9 bags</p>

<p align="left">Maya then divided both sides by .9, to get </p>

<p align="center">.1/.9 = .9 Bags/.9</p>

<p align="left">They talked about these divisions- .1/.9 = 1/9 (multiply top and
bottom by 10 or dividing 1/10 by 9/10 to get 1/9), and .9 bags divided by .9 = 1
bag) obtaining</p>

<p align="center">1/9 = 1 bag (each bag contains 1/9 of a washer)</p>

<p align="center">So the answer is x=1/9 = 0.111... , or in the wiggly brackets
she put {1/9} or {0.<span style="text-decoration: overline">1</span>}</p>

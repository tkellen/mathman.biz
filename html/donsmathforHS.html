</span></b></font><span style="color:#993300"><font size="4"><b>Don's materials
fit into any homeschooling mathematics curriculum you use, at any grade level:</b></font><o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>1. </b>Don's work
with children from ages 3 to 73, of all abilities, over the past 48 years, gives
him a unique view of what mathematics is important for children to know. <font color="#0000FF"><b> And
this has nothing to do with grade level or age</b></font>. It only has to do with what we
expect children can learn and introduce them to it in a way they can understand
it. One can always go back to fill in holes or go ahead.
Don has had students for 10-12 years, who score a 5 on the AP Calculus test. Not
all of Don's students are going to do that or even go on to college. Don even had a
student whose parents said their daughter is &quot;dumb as a box of rocks&quot;!
But Don treats all students with the same respect, and expects them to work to <b>
their</b> highest level- and this comes out in his materials.</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>2.</b> Don has had a
not insignificant number of students who <b>hate</b> math from 2nd grade on.
Part of this is due to the school's emphasis on timed tests. Part is because the
way it is presented is boring. Another part is the
abundant number of examples, <b>of the same kind</b>, they have to do for
homework. They may&nbsp;work slowly and have to spend hours every
night on these. Don would rather a student do 2 problems, but do each one 4
different ways. Knowing how to do something different ways gives one the ability
to check ones work, gives one the ability to use different concepts, and this
can carry over as an adult trying to solve problems.</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>3. </b>Most
homeschooling parents know their child better than anyone else.</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>4. </b>Don's
emphasis is on the child being an active learner- making up problems, making up
equations to solve, making up graphs to get an equation for it, making up
functions to play &quot;Guess My Rule&quot;, making up shapes on a geoboard to
find the area within it, make up equations to graph, make up geometry problems,
guessing the answer,..</p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><b>5. </b>As a teacher,
Don wants to enjoy his work, and see results.&nbsp;He thinks parents want the
same thing.</p>

your students need to have already studied Algebra and all those other courses
that seem to come before calculus?&quot;<br>
<br>
There are a lot of myths in the study of mathematics; for example &quot;you need
to division of&nbsp; whole numbers before you study fractions&quot;; &quot;you
need to know division of&nbsp; whole numbers before doing negative
numbers&quot;; we could go on and on.. Most of these myths come from the schools
of education at the universities.. (why are there so few people taking calculus
in high school?). My idea is to start young people working on important
mathematics- infinite sequences, infinite series, functions, graphs, algebra.. ,
then when they study calculus they will really understand it! And in the process
they will do a lot of arithmetic! I started a 4th grade girl working on
quadratic equations last week. When dad came in to pick her up this week, he
told me he had had a teacher conference in which he was told the class was going
back to basics (heard that before?). I then showed him what his daughter was
doing in the process of solving the quadratic equations (see ch. 8 in the sample
problems)- she was multiplying whole numbers, learning how to square numbers,
subtracting, using negative numbers, substituting in a variable, using the rules
of order of operations, learning what it means to solve an equation (make it
true), looking for patterns, and doing something that looks very complicated,
but is simple. I do a lot of algebra in chapters 6, 8, 9 and 11. The infinite
series in chapter 1 involves mostly </span><b><span style="font-size:13.5pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

one approaches the math.</span></p>

<b><font SIZE="3">And don't worry about your child making mistakes</font></b><font SIZE="3">.
The following is a quote in his little book, from <i> MATHEMATICS, THE LOSS OF
CERTAINTY</i> by Morris Kline:</font></font></p>
<p><font SIZE="3" face="Arial" color="#800000"><b>&quot;In his first paper on
the Calculus (1669), Newton proudly introduced the use of infinite series to
expedite the processes of the calculus...</b></font></p>
<p><font SIZE="3" face="Arial" color="#800000"><b>As Newton, Leibnitz, the
several Bernoullis, Euler, d'Alembert, Lagrange, and other 18th-century men
struggled with the strange problem of infinite series and employed them in
analysis, they perpetuated all sorts of blunders, made false proofs, and drew
incorrect conclusions; they even gave arguments that now with hindsight we are
obliged to call ludicrous.&quot;</b></font></p>
<p><font SIZE="3" face="Arial">If one starts at a young age, working on these
ideas, allowing for all the mistakes, one will really understand things better
later on. Don has seen children do just that and it has been very encouraging
for him. As a parent or teacher, don't feel you need to know everything before the children
see the problem. Don feels if he doesn't expect a child to solve a problem a
certain way, they will pleasantly surprise him with a new way of doing it, and he will learn something new!</font></p>

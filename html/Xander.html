<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Xander, 7 yo, came from SC to work with Don
for a week, 9-13 August 2010</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">This file and is a work in progress.</font></p>

<p align="left">Xander's Mom sent an email to
Don in Dec. of '09 to find out about a program that he could be challenged by.
He is being homschooled. She purchased Don's 2 disk set Calculus For Young
People, with all his materials. After talking with Don, his parents decided his
Dad would bring Xander to Champaign, IL to work with him for a week. Don worked
with Xander (and his Dad), from&nbsp; 9-11 am each day, and another 2 hr.
session, Wed. afternoon, to get the 12 individual hours that was contracted for.</p>

On Monday afternoon, Don sent this email (later he added scans of Xander's work)
<p>Hi
Victoria and Geoffrey,</p>
I
  just wanted you to know that I think Xander did very well this morning. I
  really enjoyed working with him.<br>
He worked on the Peg game (chapter 6). He worked with 1 peg on each side, then 2, then 3
  and finally 4.He made mistakes but that didn't seem to bother him. We started
  the table relating the number of pairs of pegs to the number of moves to move
  the pegs. He got 1,3 and 2,8 and then kind of had that look and Don asked him
  if he would like to do something different. He agreed, so Don worked with him
  on quadratic equations. We will return to the table, function and graph of the
  Peg Game later.
<p>2.
  &nbsp;Don checked to see if he knew what squaring &nbsp;5 meant (he did) and
  what 4-5=?He said 1; then Don gave him 5-4=? he said 1 and then he said 4-5=
-1. Don gave
  him quadratic equations like x2-5x+6=0, by guessing (he guessed 3 (that
  worked) and then 2 (and that worked!), then seeing the sum and product of the
  roots, gave 5 and 6 in the equation. He was able to get the 2 answers to 3
  other quadratic equations. He was stuck on x2-25x+24=0 and we talked about
  the factors of 24 until he realized that 1x 24=24 and said the 2 answers were
  1 and 24.
<p>3.
  The rule for substitution: in one equation, the same number has to go into the
  same variables (if you put a 3 in for x somewhere, you must put a 3 in for
  every x in the same equation)
<p>4.
  Made up a quadratic equation for Don (that worked) and for Dad and Mom (that
  didn't work- but he fixed those).
<p>5.
  Squaring #,s that end in 5, like 65^2= 4225 in his head, and checked these on
  a calculator. Don did this because Xander wanted to check 4 1/2 &nbsp;in the
  quadratic&nbsp;
<p>x2
  - 6&nbsp;1/2x+9=0. So Don saw a way to get him to do (4 1/2)2 or 4.52 . If
452=2025, then 4.52=20.25. This made the computation simpler!
<p>6. At a break outside, Geoffrey lifted Xander up and he helped Don put birdseed in the bird feeder.
<p>7.
  Don showed Xander how to multiply 25 times a number divisible by 4 in his
head: ex. 24x25=
  24x100/4 = (24/4)x100=600
<p>8.
  Xander borrowed the peg game and the 6-piece burr puzzle overnight.
<p>9.
  As Xander worked, Don showed Geoffrey&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 65, 112); ">IES</a>&nbsp;applets
  (a great place to see lots of good things), that Don was responsible for them
  making:

  <p>Geoffrey
  was also shown how to use Don's&nbsp;<a href="/html/map.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 65, 112); ">A
  Map to Calculus</a>&nbsp;, looking at how Alex sees an
  infinite series, Don's area under curves by plotting points on a calculator
  and Ian's (Ph.D. in math U of Chicago) using ratios and differences of powers
  of powers to get E. Don also told Geoffrey about his first student, Jonathan a
  7 yo, who came from afar (CT) to study with him for a week in 2 summers, now a
  Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Cornell. Don also showed Geoffrey a picture of
  Kirsten, getting married this month and is in one of Don's videoclips doing
  infinite series at age 7, which Geoffry has seen on youtube, also on his
  website under Infinite Series. They talked about getting Xander a calculator
  and&nbsp;Mathematica.&nbsp;Don also recommends&nbsp;<a href="http://DPGraph.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 65, 112); ">DPGraph</a>&nbsp;for
  3D graphing- powerful, easy to use and inexpensive.&nbsp;</p>
10.
  It was interesting how Geoffrey described his school math experiences..he was
  always bored in math classes, he never did any homework, was told he couldn't
  do well on the AP Calc test..he got a 5, the highest possible score! Two
  things here: 1 children don't have to write down how they do things to
  understand them and 2. people should not worry about making mistakes. Don
  finds his brightest students make more mistakes, then hone in on the answer
  and get it right.
<p>Geoffrey
  and Don talked about doing math by email with Xander after he leaves here.
  That would be great!
<p>Thank
  you Vickey, Geoffrey and Xander for a fine morning!

<p align="left"> Xander had started the work in chapter 1 Infinite Series at
home before he came to Don. He knew 1/2+1/4+... goes to 1 or 1/1 and 1/3 + 1/9 +
1/27 ... goes to 1/2
<p align="center">&nbsp;
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Xanderinfser.jpg" width="817" height="1120">

worked on below:
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Xander2div5.jpg" width="856" height="745">
<p align="left">He found the pieces, and found the sum of the 1st 5 terms to be
0.65984.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Xander2over5dad.jpg" width="677" height="773">
<p align="left">His Dad worked with him overnight to see 0.65984 is getting
close to 2/3 = 0.666... So 2/5+... goes to 2/3. Don asked him where the 2 and
the 3 come from and he saw the 2 came from the top and the 3 came from 5-2. When
Don gave him 7/12 +&nbsp; + (7/12)<b><font size="2"><sup>2 </sup></font></b>+
(7/12)<b><font size="2"><sup>3 </sup></font></b>+ ... he knew that would go to
7/(12-7)= 7/5 and wrote this as a mixed number and decimal!
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/XanderAoverB-A.jpg" width="741" height="444">
<p align="center">He generalized to A/B + (A/B)<b><font size="2"><sup>2 </sup></font></b>+
(A/B)<b><font size="2"><sup>3 </sup></font></b>+ ... -&gt; A/(B-A)&nbsp; !!!
<p align="left">In between all of this fine work he and Don would play NIM, he
would try to make the 3x3x3 cube from the 7 Soma pieces, play with The Tower
Puzzle, and the Peg game.
<p align="left">Then Don showed him the <font color="#800000" size="4"><b>
Guess my number game</b></font> with the cards:
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/guessnumcards.JPG" width="441" height="393">
<p align="left">Don had Xander make these numbers on 3&quot;x5&quot; cards. As the leader, you say &quot;Pick a whole number from 1 to 31,
no fractions, and don't tell me what it is. I will tell you your number. Is your number on
card A? Is your number on card B? &quot; and so on through card E. If the person
says their number is on cards A, B and D, for example, you add the numbers in
the upper left hand corner of those cards A, B and D, or 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 which is
the person's number! Now try this on your friends, parents and teachers!
<p align="left">Don wanted Xander to figure out why this game worked, so he
worked with Xander on counting in binary (base 2, compared to base 10, our
decimal system). Don set up the charts for decimal counting and binary counting.
The place-values in decimal are ..1000, 100, 10, 1,.., while in binary the
place-values are ..16, 8, 4, 2, 1,.... Don made marks on the right below and
wrote in decimal 1, 2. 3.. and in binary 1, 10 (one group of 2), 11, (one group
of 2 and 1 more and so on. Xander picked up on this quickly.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Xanderbinary.jpg" width="586" height="800">
<p align="left">Notice that if you look down the ones column in binary, the
numbers alternate 1,0,1,0,1,0.. Which decimal numbers have a 1 in the ones place in
binary? They are 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 11, .. the odd numbers to 31. These are the numbers on card A! Which
decimal numbers have a 1 in the 2's place in binary? 2,3, 6,7, 10,11, 15,16..
These numbers are on card B! And so on. Complete the rest.
<p align="left">If<i> </i>the person who picks the number, says their number is
on cards A, B, C, and E, the leader adds the number in the upper left corner of
those cards 1+2+4+16=23 and announces their number is 23!
<p align="left"><b><font color="#800000" size="4">Cookie-sharing -using
3x5&quot; cards (NOT circles, too hard), and scissors</font></b>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">Share 3 cookies between 2 people:
Xander quickly got 1 1/2 cookies for each person.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#000000">He ignored Share 6 cookies
between 7 people, so Don gave him shae 2 cookies between 3 people.</font>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/Xandercookies.jpg" width="629" height="835">
<p align="left">Xander cut the 2 cookies into 2 pieces, then 4 pieces. He had 8
pieces, each 1/4 of a cookie. He shared 2/4 with each of the 3 people. Then each
person had 2/4 or 1/2 of a cookie and there were 2- quarters left over. Then he
cut each quarter into 3 pieces. Don immediately asked Xander what the nane of
each of these 6 pieces. How many of each of these pieces make a whole cookie?
Well 3 make a fourth, and 4-fourths make the whole cookie, so 12 of each make
the whole cookie. So each piece is 1/12 of a cookie, he said. So each person
gets 1/2 + 2/12 = 6/12 + 2/12 = 8/12 of a cookie = 2/3 of a cookie.&nbsp;
<p align="left">Don then asked Xander if he could use Brad's method to share the
2 cookies between 3 people again, only now he is cut to into 2 pieces, share,
then cut into 2 pieces.&nbsp; While Xander cut and named the pieces, Don wrote
down the size of the piece each person got:&nbsp;
